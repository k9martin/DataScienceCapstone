Mother Earth and all humanity are currently going through tremendous change, a Change in Consciousness, many say. And everywhere we turn around, changes and transitions are taking place! According to a unique healer and teacher of sacred geometry who has been connected to the native traditions around the world for a long while, Drunvalo Melchizedek, the way to live today is to be “centered in the heart,” not in the brain. One might say that this is the “shift” that’s taking place today: We are moving from being brain and mind-centered to heart and soul centered. As I quote Jesus in my book, The Last Adventure of Life, the last judgment will be the judgment again judgment itself!

I love the crystal heart in the center, and I love it even more that my Mom made it for me, as a surprise. I also had a second garter to toss, which was a story itself. I bought a tacky NCSU adorned garter way before the wedding, forgot about it, then remembered the day of that I didn't have a garter to toss. My aunt stitched up a garter that afternoon with a red ribbon to toss instead. This one however is in Stephen's safekeeping!
It is learned that Minister in the Prime Minister Department, Koh Tsu Koon, got the ball rolling during a meeting with editors from several Chinese dailies yesterday.
When we were on our way home from Greenville one day, I had to jump in the backseat to care for E. So I nestled in between W and E, and W started rubbing my arm and saying, "Hey Precious." I'm sure he has heard that from his grandmother Bippie, and it was the sweetest thing ever.

Confronted by these facts, we can hardly avoid the conclusion that the heavy task laid upon the American Negro, after liberation from slavery, has proved too much for him, and that this people, considered as a whole, is slowly but surely tending to revert. Seized and transplanted unwillingly, forced sharply into new and severely exacting habits of life, held for a time in this condition of strain, and then suddenly released, the Negro finds it surpassingly difficult to suppress the hereditary instincts that do not harmonize with American social organization.

Answer that one, and I suspect that many of the presently intractable problems of science and philosophy will simply dissolve away.
Whoa...what's this about another creative outlet?
It seems that the past few years of my life have been primarily composed of the latter variety of hiccup. An assortment of enemies appeared out of the woodwork to take a shot at threatening my existence. First, there was this skeleton in the closet, and he emerged, bones rattling, cutlass in hand, and commenced to mar the walls with its unique brand of destruction. Then a monster crawled out from under the bed and howled like a banshee until my nerves began to fray at the edges and the weakened beams of the house began to crumble.
So by now it was time to call the Telecommunications Ombudsman and register a complaint. The lady I spoke to there did assure me that there would have to some evidence of a debt existing if it had to be paid. At last, a voice of reason! And of action, apparently - only a few moments later Ms DC from the collection agency called me and told me that Optus had recalled the debt, and that I wouldn't be hearing any more from them, the matter was resolved from their point.

Nigella Lawson is my favorite cook. It occurred to me one day that my daughter, Sayaka Alessandra, http://www.sayakaalessandraofficial.com/, instead of resembling me, resembles Nigella...well, not physically perhaps :) but the long hair and the accent, but mostly in the messy cooking, so I suggested that she do a parody of Nigella.
That evening they mesmerized me with more stories about their trip. Kent cigarette packages worked well with border inspectors without our gifts confiscated.

The hops were all very fresh, barley being a year old. Per the usual for BP beers they were all middle Kentish. One single addition at makeup was the extent of the kettle hopping. That being said, the single hop addition totaled a whopping 75-80 BU’s. Just as important as the BU count is the huge amount of tannins this much hop material would deliver. Using anything other than low alpha acid hops in this recipe will significantly change the flavor profile of this beer. A small amount of dry hops were added that would have given just a slight hint of the spicy Goldings.

7. Champions commit themselves to the ministry of a local church. They don’t float around! Only those who are planted in the courts of our God will flourish (Psalms 92:12-14). And don’t tell me you can’t seem to find a perfect church. Even if you find one, don’t join. Why? You’ll make it imperfect! Find a Bible-based church that teaches the Word of God and connect yourself with that family of faith. Find a place to serve there. Actively participate in the body-life and you’ll see the results.
Several years ago, while attempting to leave the established parade route during a City-approved rally several years ago, I was physically restrained by an Auxiliary officer who demanded I throw away my foam board poster (which read "Justice Not Violence") before cutting through the police barricades. She said I might use the poster as a weapon, prompting me to wonder if she could read.

Natural incretins are very short-lived, which is why the GLP-1 agonist drugs are not quite the same as the human versions - they have been designed to hang around a bit longer. GLP-1 is broken down in the body by an enzyme called DPP-4, and a class of drugs called gliptins inhibit the activity of DPP-4, thus preventing the breakdown of GLP-1 and increasing its availability in the body. Gliptins can be taken as tablets, which gives them an advantage over injectable incretins.

As always it was lovely to meet up with some of the bloggers I've come to know and love dearly! I spent my time with Becky from The Ramblings of Mrs Bebe, La Cara from Oh La La Curves, Naomi from Diamonds 'n' Pearls , Joanne from Just Joanna and finally Amy from These Girls Turn Heads. I do believe there were some other lovely ladies there to but I can't remember names, so sorry! I met up with Becky to arrive at head office together and then also met up with Joanne when we (eventually) got to Oxford street after thinking we could walk from Kings Cross to head office in the end we got completely lost and admitted defeat and got on the tube and then had a cheeky bit of food before the event!

More than anything, I wanted to reach out and take his hurt away. But I was trapped in a bad dream. Immobilized. Inadequate. Helpless. Though God had assigned me to love and care for this beautiful child, I could do nothing to minimize his pain. My thoughts were an inward scream. This isn’t what I signed up to do, God! I don’t want to be a helpless onlooker. I want to parent my child. How can I care for him? What can I do?

Hogan makes the announcement and chooses Anderson and Hardy, the match is on now.
The bulk of the book is the section "Rejections and Responses." The remainder of the book consists of the text of the patent statutes and a Table of Cases. My personal opinion is that the patent statute section is a waste of paper because if I want the text of a statute I look to the MPEP (online or my two-volume softcover). But going to a second source is an extra step, so maybe some will find it useful to have the statutes in this book.
I would play the priest and my cousins would be the churchgoers. My cousins would arrange themselves as though they were in pews. I would walk down the aisle carrying the cross, and sprinkling my cousins with “holy water.” My cousins would be holding their palm leaves waving them up and down. When I reach the “altar,” they would line up, and I would say “the body of Christ” and they would say “Amen” and I’d give them haw flakes.

If you look at decades of scientific evidence, across hundreds of empirical studies, what you find couldn't be more clear: negative biases against people of color in America are real. I know this might be an uncomfortable fact to swallow for many people, given that this suggests that many of us (me included) have racial biases--but it is a fact built on a solid scientific foundation. So, before you get too angry with my point, let me review two classic studies that illustrate the clear facts about racial bias in America.

The United States was the champion of liberty and freedom throughout the world. Before this time no nation in history ever had a written constitution that guaranteed the liberty and freedom of its people. But the glorious beginning of this country was to be corrupted in later years. The gentle, gracious, freedom-loving character of the United States in its youth was later used as a facade to hide the character that this country subsequently developed. This facade has successfully kept hidden, even from most of its own citizens, the real character the United States developed in these last days as a result of Jesuit infiltration and subversion.
It's funny the way this is worded. My parents just got a new refrigerator, and at one point, the contents were removed and placed on the floor. So maybe it isn't that crazy an idea. My kids have never tried to empty the contents of the refrigerator onto the floor, so I don't know if I would allow it. But I might use it as an opportunity to wipe the shelves before I put everything away again. I wouldn't consider it that different from the kids taking out their toys or art supplies to play with.

But like I said, not going to dwell on it now in regards to my posts.
Real gangs possess a sort of physical strength and presence that me and my ‘friends’ simply don’t have. The answer: Get tough. We’re going to start going to the gym, and bench pressing scantily clad women and exercise bikes with a previously dictated selection of our ten fingers. I said this because that’s pretty much the only things I’ve found at my local gym that are heavy enough to lift and look tough doing. We’ve already organised. Me and me mates are going to do boxing, running on the beach, stretches and shiz and cage fighting juvenile bears. Also taekwondo. By the end we should be so damn awesome we’d be able to take on any of the other measly gangs and groups that operate in our little town with contemptuous ease. We’ll also be able to take on the Lads, depending how many of them there are. I hear they hang outside shopping malls searching for brand name clothing and funny looking people to abuse. We’ll put a stop to that. But being tough and whatnot is only a small part of being a gang. The other part is collectivism. Yay! Collectivism!

Journalism appears to have no eye for a story these days. The events of yesterday were not — as the MSM have implied — simply about a few right-wing wackos with an inbuilt hatred of the religion of peace; it was far more importantly about freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, or more succinctly, democracy.
We live in a society where food prices are set to go only one way: up. We also live in a society (at least in the UK) where all the land has been divided up between a handful of the people. Only 3% of land in the UK today is common land. Both land and property are becoming further and further out of the reach of ordinary people. We are forced instead to be completely dependent on the mercy of landlords, our money pouring out of our accounts into their pockets with nothing of our own to show for it. We a bundled closer and closer together into smaller and smaller apartments and flats where it becomes difficult to grow or produce anything which makes us completely at the mercy of the supermarkets and agribusiness. We are not a free people anymore, we are unable to affect change, we are unable to chose a path of self-sufficiency and we are subject to a great many market forces beyond our control.
Overall, a sense of dumbing down the novel: This is my major complaint overall, but one that is hard to articulate. I got the feeling that where the book aimed for a late-teen to early 20s audience, the film was pandering to younger, ostensibly less-sophisticated viewers. Some of this is evident in/a product of the sanitization and the other factors mentioned above, but it really stuck out to me in the overt explanations of how one gets sponsors by being likable as the only way to do so. In the novel there are various ways tributes get sponsored–often because they are badass killers with a good chance to win (the wealthy Capitolites are betting, remember?). More importantly, like some other elements obviously explained in the film, Katniss mostly has to discover how this works herself rather than being directly told. This is just one element that I think limits how resourceful and smart the film’s Katniss comes across as.

As always the Treacy family and their exemplary team headed by the never-ageing Niamh O Shea looked after us with that characteristic “warmth beyond the smile”. This year Padraig Treacy went the extra mile. Or, rather, the extra 10 miles by leading us on a wilderness walk that took us across the side of Tomies Mountain and back to the lakeshore at Dinis Cottage. It was a challenging walk with that vague edge of soft danger to it leaving you with a real sense of achievement at the end. The scenery was breathtaking, sufficient to render a predominantly female group speechless from time and time and evoking in us all what Wordsworth called that “serene and blessed mood”.

Why didn't the midwife tell me, after I'd gone in several times for bleeding, that I wasn't a candidate for midwifery care anymore? Why didn't I get an ultrasound to look for the source of that bleeding? Why didn't she know that the presence of blood could give a false negative on a ferning test? Why didn't she order an ultrasound immediately upon my coming in with the concern that my water had broken? In retrospect, waiting three days was completely insane. But I trusted her when she said everything was okay. Why didn't she consult with one of the doctors at that point? The midwife practice I was seeing was in a hospital, and shared office space, staff, and the L&D area with both the regular OBs and the high-risk doctors. Why didn't I insist on a second opinion??

Things have been much quieter this week, I don’t know whether to be relieved or not?! I’ve spent the week in the office updating Palm Garden Resort’s TripAdvisor page, battling with Google Businesses to try and get a Places listing (this has been interesting considering that Mercator Assistance, like most places in Rwanda, doesn’t have an address and relies on a Post Box, but Google, in its infinite wisdom, doesn’t accept PO box addresses!), updating the Facebook and Twitter pages, re-designing the Palm Garden Resort website and linking this to TripAdvisor in an apparently futile attempt to get them to recategorise Palm Garden as a B&B not a ‘speciality lodging’, what ever that may be. On top of that I’ve been trying to engage in some direct marketing of Mercator Assistance to Soroptimists Clubs and cycling and triathlon clubs and magazines. Doing all this on African time and African efficiency has been wearing at times! But hey, its all good experience!
In true Westminster tradition, unless you actually knew what the bill contained, something you won’t necessarily get from its name, you might have been at loss about the significance of the Grocery Code Adjudicator Bill.

okay so my sister was NOT thrilled that I was letting the dog close to her bundle of joy… She was not alright with me allowing her kid to touch the howler’s face and fur. But I am an asshole, and I firmly believe in getting babies used to dogs, and dogs getting used to babies. The howler loves kids – he’s drawn to them. He wants to be friends with them. He’s a very friendly, very curious and social dog. And honestly, he is my kid and I want my niece and him to be great friends.

This is a term used to describe a crème anglaise mixed with whipped cream. Our recipe, however, is for a standalone dessert that most reminds me of vanilla mousse. It is cut with some candied fruit which tastes pretty old-fashioned, and I would encourage the esteemed reader to experiment with other flavours instead because the cream is definitely a keeper. This way, it is slightly reminiscent of Zuppa Inglese.

The only person who appears to not be ungrateful (or, to state it more positively, the only person who appears to be grateful) is Joseph, and he was on the bottom of the stack. He was neither the king nor the king’s officers (the cupbearer and the baker) nor the jailer, but from the bottom of life, from the role of the imprisoned servant, he served them all. And yet he was grateful, and everyone else (except maybe the jailer, we don’t know anything about him from this reading today) is ungrateful. Just from this observation alone, it would appear that gratitude is associated with imprisonment and poverty and ingratitude is associated with wealth and power.

The origin of the previously described mysterious noisome aromatic residue of a long dead tabby tom in the childhood bedroom of E@L has been sourced. Sleep easy one and all. It used to be that whenever (usually Christmas) E@L arrived from his sojourn in the Far Orient, he would be ensconced in this room and instantly his presence would stir the unmistakable stench of a crusty old cat intent on ensuring his domain was marked with a copious burst of pungent you-rine. Pee-you indeed! The fact that this tom had been long deceased - we are talking many, many years, like six, seven, eight - did little to diminish the olfactory memory of his attraction to E@L's den of repose.
I panicked a little about whether or not the frogs might be poisonous. Then he said this all took place two days before. Since no one died (aside from the frogs) I guess that rules out poison. So good to know.

I found the book interesting but it lacked the punch Laymon’s books are famous for. Several times I found myself rolling my eyes because no one in their right mind would do the stupid things the characters did. Seriously, if I was being chased by an invisible sex-crazed maniac killer, I think I wouldn’t hesitate blowing the asshole away the first chance I got. One scene I swear was put in there just so the killer could rape the two remaining females in the story.
50 is nifty I’ve been told. Well I know that I’ll do my best to enjoy and move forward and get to know me as a person instead of just as a mom. I know that I have again gained some of my weight back and that is unacceptable so that means more work to be done. However I knew that I was going to be working on this and April 23rd is that day to start on it. I don’t have to start over since I’m not back to where I was but I am part ways there so just going to continue on this life style journey of getting to be the healthiest me I can be.
These monopolies control their markets killing off the competition by getting corporate welfare from their friends in government. They destroy our environment as did British Petroleum, and The Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf-of-Mexico in April of 2010. They spilled 100s of millions of barrels of petroleum into the Gulf killing wild life, destroying the health of 10s of thousands of people, closing down 100s of local businesses, and contaminating the land for 87 consecutive days. It’s still contaminated two years later with blooms of petroleum floats around in the ocean. It’s going to take hundreds of years for the Gulf to clear up from these toxic waters filled with oil. There were 225,000 claims file against BP, and The Deepwater Horizon and they settled for 7.8 billion in this law suit, or about 27,000 per claim this was an abuse of political power. http://globalwarming.house.gov/spillcam

What’s unsympathetic in Guy comes from Granger’s performance--the shifting eyes, the impatient, petulant tone, the “everything happens to me” attitude he brings to so much of what happens; and that choice shows great nerve on Granger’s part. Given a role of ambiguous morality, he increases the questions about the character, rather than trying to emphasize the good-Guy qualities.
It strikes me that Trella is one of the more realistic characters I’ve run into. She makes mistakes and then seeks to remedy them. Some days, I feel like that’s all I do. She’s strong and brave, but sometimes she really just wants to get away and explore. Perhaps my favorite part about Trella is how it takes her a little while to come around to things. She had brilliant plans that fabricate instantly, but when it comes to the really big things in her life, she’s a little slow on the uptake and that’s the most human trait Snyder could have built into her. It makes it so much easier to empathize with her.

Though it is reasonable if some would only desire to stick with one type of book to avoid confusion (or maybe for OCD purposes), I would personally like to provide this final observation for categorizing the genre of book with the type (or format) for, in my opinion, the best usage of books.

How good were they? Damned good, but don't take my word for it: I took them to a Super Bowl party today, and two people asked me where I bought the sausage. Made it, I said. Wow, they said, it's great! Score!

Our boot camps were out of this world. I wanted a good butt kicking, and Eva delivered. Naturally, I was nervous. Everyday was a new kind of challenge. I LOVED the surprise element and never knowing what the next exercise was. The day of the 100′s will be burned into my mind forever. I remember when she first said 100 reps, I thought she was kidding so I chuckled. Then when I realized she wasn’t kidding, I was scared but gave it my all. My favourite 100 reps was for the abs. The most challenging was the pushups.
Also, I've been trying to write a Christmas list this week, but there is genuinely nothing that I want except tickets to The Strokes (not that they're even going on tour), Alex Turner/Harry Styles's hand in marriage and Alexa Chung's legs, wardobe and hair. Somehow I kind of doubt these things will turn up under my tree, so instead I'm just looking forward to eating a ton of chocolate.

For example, if you grow strawberries, alternate them with a row of marigolds, they will taste even better!

At the fabulous Silk Route, we have a delicious dinner of Vegetable Pot Sticker Dumplings, Paw Pia Pak (Vegetable spring rolls), Pad Thai and other delectable vegetable Thai dishes. After dinner, we go back to our room, where Alex and I settle in for the night. Adam has made other plans to go back to the Intercontinental with Christian and his friends. He has had a taste of the bar scene, and now I guess he’s hooked!!
At the event, I spoke to the many brides and event planners who attended about infusing their personality into the design of their event. I love graphic patterns so I wanted to infuse a bold pattern into the dessert table to show how I would bring a design that I loved into a dessert table. My thought was take a modern look that one might find on a Tory Burch tunic or a Jonathan Adler pillow (love them both!) and bring that into the event. With that, we created our own version of the classic greek key pattern for a modern and chic dessert table. We used that pattern for signage such as a backdrop, stickers, marshmallow flags, and candy bar wrappers. We had the "ridiculously talented" Cake Divas whip up a cake, cupcakes, cookies and petite fours using our greek key pattern. We even created greek key pattern flower sculptures using green mums. The idea is that you can take any pattern and color scheme and make your dessert table (or event design) completely your own. We had a "ridiculous" time creating this table and we hope that you enjoy our creation!

“When I’m homeless I’m always surrounded by friends.

Her early arrival would be the result of an induced labour. There are two reasons why this might happen. One, my sister’s blood pressure is high. This is a common end of pregnancy issue, but still undesirable. Two, baby Olivia is apparently gigantic. She’s the size of a baby one and a half weeks older than she is. My sister’s doctor is concerned about letting her get any bigger pre-delivery.
In the Barisan, the seat-swapping issue is still being sorted out and has not even gone to the supreme council level yet.
They had the oracles of God; a religious history and heritage, yes, even God’s name for themselves. What they failed to understand was that their sin estranged them from God, and now, even to the point of setting them aside. For all those years, they put God to the test. Hear these words to Israel in Exodus 23:21.

Olivier has his suspicions about his son’s death in custody. "I have photographs of my son in his casket. He looks as if he’s been beaten up. He had no mark on his face when he was arrested." Meanwhile, Lefekane insists that there was "nothing untoward regarding this case. He was arrested for drunkenness, and he committed suicide by hanging himself in his cell.

With the momentum that genetic research has been gaining over the last 20 years I wish to propose a new subject of research – to work on genetically engineering the human DNA to allow us to develop a thin layer of photosynthetic moss over our skin! It would be perfect - when ever you are feeling hungry you simply step outside into the sunlight for 15 minutes and your new mossy skin will generate enough glucose to keep you energised for hours. Although not all of your required recommended dietary intake will be satisfied by your new ability to feed off of the sun, I imagine that we could fine-tune it down to only one required meal per day. This would still allow for the daily family meal that us Westerners value so much.

This is one the kids chose. I think it's great that they want to learn it, and I will support them in it. I think it's important that they learn to type and use certain programs, but learning programming is totally optional. I have to admit, I have been enjoying doing Logo with them. I'm not sure if I'll continue working with them on programming when they move to other programming languages, though.
I’ve remarked before that the DC Council seems better at making good policies than at providing the oversight and resources needed to make them work.

During April’s morning school visit, the students showed such enthusiasm and warmth! Two students at each presentation played the role of presidential candidates and offered their ideas about the issues they would address to the American people. And two more students presented amazing performances as the President of the United States. I wonder if there was a future mayor, senator, governor or even president in the audience that day…

Reading over these reasons, I can see clearly why I never wanted to go on a break. All of these reasons make the parties involved with the break seem weak. They’re too afraid to make a final decision, so they want to leave the door open for the possibility of getting back together, but they’re not entirely sure that’s what they want. It’s very wishy-washy and noncommittal, and it just doesn’t seem like it makes any sense, to sensible people.

By the time Girl Crazy came to the screen again, Hollywood's attitude toward musicals had changed diametrically, and with a will. A look at Clive Hirschhorn's comprehensive coffee-table book The Hollywood Musical tells the tale: 10 musicals in 1932, when the first woebegone movie of Girl Crazy came out, versus 50 of them in 1942, the year MGM decided to do it again, and 75 in 1943, when MGM's Girl Crazy was released. By now, musicals had become the jewels in Hollywood's crown. Even Universal's remake of The Phantom of the Opera had more opera and less phantom than the original silent version with Lon Chaney (sound gave Universal some wiggle room, and they decided to fill it with singing).
Granola bars, shampoo, deodorant, tooth paste, presents for the boys, oh and 2 books!!! I am so excited about the books! I found out that the book store here sells books in English and I found some books that are in a series that I started earlier this year and I am so excited to read more books from the series :)

With the breast meat set aside and decided upon, now we have all the rest of it to deal with. Usually All The Rest is a broken-looking thing. The wings, maybe a drumstick or a thigh plus the anonymous bits and pieces clinging to the back, especially those pocket oysters - my favorite part of any whole chicken. Stack ‘em up and there’s quite a bit of meat. Sometimes it’s enough for another meal but more often you’re left kind of a drumstick short of reality. This is when other leftovers come in handy. A few frozen shrimp, perhaps a hunk of ham or some smoked sausage?

I’d like to say I always wanted to be a writer, but that’s not the case. First I wanted to be a teacher. When I was a kid I used to play school in my friend’s basement. She had actual school desks—and index cards. I’m a list maker, so those index cards rocked my world. Then later on, I wanted to be a nurse. My other friend had a stethoscope and a medical book. I had a thing for props, okay?
So this is Plan B: a summer-special post of vegetable cheese sandwiches. When I think of all the food on this planet that I consider to be sublimely craveable, a simple sandwich of bread and cheese would be pretty high on the list. Add vegetables to the sandwich, and you have a winner! Here are three favorites of mine. All three sandwiches are designed to be thrown together in a jiffy, and to be eaten in a jiffy too, which accounts for the hasty photographs taken seconds before the sandwiches were devoured. A sandwich or two, washed down with a tall glass of something cold (iced coffee or tea, or fruit juice) is the perfect summer meal.
Any pain involved in facing our issues is well worth the effort in the end. When we face our problems instead of avoiding them, we free our energy and transform ourselves from people who run away into people who move enthusiastically forward.

But the most disappointing character is far and away Anthony Quinn’s Captain Vinolas, a surprisingly boring villain. We see him romancing a mistress and lighting candles asking God to help him slay Artiguez, but that’s it as far as his psychological troubles go. Zinnemann also fails to draw striking parallels between Vinolas and Artiguez. You’d think Quinn and Peck would have a lot in common, but the most Zinnemann can do is make them both out to be incredibly salty, lecherous men who can’t seem to resist checking out a fine woman’s ass.
Multiple sources, including ESPN and The Sporting News, are reporting that Red Sox GM Theo Epstein has agreed to a five year deal worth more than $15 million with the Chicago Cubs. While the Sox and Cubs are still discussing compensation for Epstein, since he is still under contract with Boston, sources are saying that finalizing the deal is close. Epstein would most likely be named Cubs President, a promotion from his role in Boston.

Jessica, Skylar and Hollie performed ‘Higher and Higher’ by Jackie Wilson as a trio. Randy said the girls’ performance sounded amazing, while J.Lo said it’s a real treat to have them singing together. And if one of them wins, it’ll be the first female winner in five seasons. The last was — drumroll, please — was Jordin Sparks during Season 6.
Salad or Soup? If it’s a great salad, salad, but if we’re talking your average salad and your average soup, soup. I particularly like tomato soup on rainy days like today.

I’m in the middle of three books right now, and have no more shelf space, but I couldn’t resist. I had the first two on my must-read list, the second two just looked fantastic and the last one was on the sale table. Besides, I was in one of my favorite bookstores, McNally Robinson and they were carrying Paris, My Sweet.
The Austrian Fortess has 3 bastions and three ravelins, and is surrounded by a water-filled moat. The high water table precludes any mining (something we did do in out first playtest game several months ago). The garrison consisted of the Commander, 3 Fortress batteries, 4 Line Infantry, One Grenadier, and one Elite Light Infantry unit, plus an additional 2 medium and one light battery, augmented by a spy! That is my 20+ year old Gallia castle serving as the Fortress!
But wait a minute. The standard deviation of price rises for iron (5), coal, copper, corn and silver (4), sorghum, palladium, and rubber (3.5), flaxseed, palm oil, soybeans, coconut oil, and nickel (3), and so on down through jute, cotton, uranium, tin, zinc, potosh and wool (2) are so unlikely that they quite simply could not have happened. Individually. Together, the likelihood that we’ve got an unlikely boom in almost all of the 33 commodities? All at the same time? Impossible. Cannot happen. Not in the lifetime of our sun, let alone our planet. But it did.

As I stated before, I have seen all these films(minus Red State) while Liz has seen only a few of them. So it was with great pleasure, and only a slight bit of trepidation, that I slid in my old DVD of Clerks for us to begin this odd experiment. The only thoughts I truly had entering into the viewing were that A) I hadn’t watched this film in a couple of years but was pretty sure that I could quote it line by line if I needed to and B) I hope that the humor holds up for Liz.

So today we celebrate the Equinox with a Hindu holiday called Nyepi. It’s basically a day of purification when Hindus (and anyone living in Bali) may not use any technology AT ALL. Everything shuts down. No traffic, no pedestrians, no home appliances, no TeeVee, and no one leaves the house. The Hindus spend outrageous amounts of money on something called ogoh-ogoh. These are elaborate constructs designed to entice and trap various spirits that ‘pollute’ the realm of the living throughout the rest of the year. Folks place them in front of their homes and groups get together and erect huge ones in public areas.

And of course the responsibility is huge. If I do a studio shoot and my camera or computer decide to wipe all the images without my consent, then I can always apologise, call the client back on another day and give them a discount for the inconvenience.

DAP’s focus tends to emphasize their party leader Lim Guan Eng. Most of the DAP members failed to be present in the forum sessions held from morning till pre-debate. Most of the reserved seats stood empty. Only when the debate was about to commence, only then were the the seats occupied. This proves that DAP supporters do not care for the rest of the DAP speakers at the forum, which include Dr Tan Sing Giaw, Chong Eng, Liew Chin Tong and Teoh Nie Ching.
I believe it was during Micky Dolenz' scat-singing routine in "Goin' Down" that I realized my keys weren't in my pocket anymore. I looked around on the ground and couldn't find them. Most folks would've bolted right then, but those tickets set me back at least 15 bucks and I wasn't going to miss one goddamn second of Mike Nesmith-less Monkee magic.

I did quite a bit of research on places to visit and of course asked Tasmanian friends what we should not miss. This list was extensive so I got out a map and started plotting which direction to circumnavigate and the best places to stop. We have friends and family who live there and we wished to visit so they had to be included in our itinerary.

Bring to a slow boil, then reduce heat and simmer for at least an hour. When the sauce is thickened and flavorful, spoon into pasta and stir. This pasta and sauce mixture can be spooned into waiting containers to make TV Dinners for another rainy night. I put steamed asparagus or broccoli on the other side of my divided containers and popped everything into the freezer (after allowing to cool).
It's harder in Seattle. In Paris I wrote primarily about French people, none of whom were ever going to read what I wrote. Here I'm writing about people who know about the blog and sometimes even read it if they are trapped in a small space with nothing else to do.
Exhausted. All the other things that I am feeling from dealing with everything that is going on is draining me, both physically and mentally. There are times where I know I need to study or work on homework or go to an event, but I would much rather just curl up in my bed and sleep. Sleeping seems to make everything disappear at least for a little while. And to be able to just give my brain that time to relax helps a lot.

Frustrated by seeing the more superior Williams of Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell often get the better of him despite his undoubted talent, Senna was convinced the switch to McLaren would finally give him the success it craved. There he was partnered with the Frenchman Alain Prost, the golden boy of McLaren at the time. Fireworks would explode between the pair, though not initially. The 1988 McLaren Honda was the most dominant car in Grand Prix history, winning 15 of the season’s 16 races. If Jean-Louis Schelesser hadn’t taken Senna out in the closing stages at Monza, it could well have been a clean sweep. Senna won eight races to Prost’s seven – though the ‘Professor’s’ consistency meant he went on to score more championship points. However on a countback system, which the sport used at the time, Senna knew that victory in the 1988 Japanese Grand Prix would be enough for his first championship.

And if I occasionally remembered how the light felt on my face in the summer sun, or the electricity in the words that poured out of my fingers when I knew it was working…? Well, that was the past, wasn’t it? And the past should stay the past, right, because people who tried to escape the labyrinth were seldom heard from again by those good and proper souls who kept their heads down and didn’t listen to the dreams that whispered to them in their waking hours. And you try not to think of all those wasted years in the darkness, because that only leads to Regret. And if Laziness is Fear’s bratty kid brother, then Regret is his sad-eyed spinster aunt.
This has to be one of the biggest cards I've ever made and probably the first square card I've made as well. I'm pleased with the way my layout translated into card form.

The alien Slithergees are a marvellous creation, constantly heaping self-pity on the humans and using manipulation to dominate. It is hilarious how often the Slithergee leader utters the pathetic line "I am a poor, blind Slithergee." It is unusual for a Seventh Doctor story to go right-wing and attack politically-correct values. This story is clearly hitting out at lobbies that defend the rights of the disabled and ethnic minorities (not necessarily a line I would want to take, though I am a Tory). Seventh Doctor stories have tended to be far more left-liberal than this.

This is partly the point. Delores is not so much an individual as a representation of an idea—in this case, an unsavoury one, too prominent in silent-era filmmaking. She is the virgin to be protected: Caucasian, Christian; unbowed through faith. Delores symbolizes what we fight for, no matter who’s fighting us or why. She’s a treasure of limitless value, if you’re feeling poetic enough to say so. But her value can be measured. “The fairest gem of the Occident,” declares one appraiser in Old San Francisco.
Twenty minutes on the cross-trainer at full resistance is enough to make me breathless, sweaty and leave a pleasant blank hole in my mind where all the stresses and strains of the day were just a few minutes ago.

In understanding the existence of God, we can see the realities in this world. God created the earth, planets and space in a perfect constellation and not collide with each other, is clear evidence that God exists. Everything in the created, like humans, animals and plants should make us always remember the existence of God. Humans sometimes forget the existence of God. Is there anything wrong that people sometimes forget with their creator?
Re-reading this post, it sounds like my day was pretty boring, but I did enjoy it a great deal; maybe that’s the mark of comfort. I know Delhi is busy, and I can see the millions of people swarming from place to place, but it just doesn’t feel that way. This might be a function of me being more comfortable with India or Delhi just being a wonderful place to live, but either way I am glad I get another day here to experience it some more.
As a child, I searched for shadows. Under trees at high noon when the crown of an acacia tree from across our balcony covered its root space like a clipped parasol, I’d creep to it and hug the ancient roots, basking in its shadow. By the stream where my grandmother scoured the soot off the iron rice pot and skillet, I’d haunt the silken strips of shadows under bamboo groves. I waited on the engorged shadow of a kingfisher that never failed to fly by.

What I've learned from playing this with several classes now is that my fifth grade students are more engaged with my ACTUAL lesson, which is to point out some ways that they can begin to distinguish whether a Wikipedia article has merit. Some of these points include looking at the amount of references and notes at the end of the article, noticing whether the page has had a rating, and looking for other signs that the article needs to be "cleaned up."
What is bad? Not much, actually. Data turns traitor yet again, or at least appears to when seduced by the Borg Queen. His ‘betrayal’ is this unnecessarily long, drawn out process in which he even fires near misses at Cochran’s ship to prove. That seems like an enormously risky just to create false drama. I also think Worf’s involvement is awfully contrived, but not as badly as it will be in Insurrection. Yes, the Defiant was built to fight the Borg, but does it not seem strange that DS9’s big dogs would not take the ship into the fray rather than Worf and some second stringers? It has to be that way for the sake of the movie, but still…illogical. As is the idea the Vulcans never detect the Enterprise because of the moon’s gravitational pull. Yes, the moon moves the oceans and hides starships.

I am also very RELIEVED! You see, I have homeschooled Ruby since pre-school and had a lot of people who were convinced I was going to turn her into this backward little weirdo who spent all day hiding in the basement, talking to her imaginary friends... (That would actually be ME and I went to public school.) Instead she turned into an intelligent, beautiful lady who regularly wears out the batteries on my phone. Where is this quiet, antisocial kid these people promised me?!!! They ought to have to pay our phone bill! Sheesh.... LOL If the other 3 munchkins grow up to be even half this awesome I will die a happy mama! ;o)

’cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.
Each time I do a cover critique, I challenge myself to find covers that are more soul-scarring, disturbing, or ridiculous than the last set and I often worry I won't be able to top the week prior in those particular areas. This week I really needn't have worried. I believe the crotch o'flame was pretty memorable a couple weeks ago, but the ones I have today I think will haunt most of you for the remainder of your lives. No thank you necessary my friends, I do this out of the goodness of my heart because I find such fulfillment in sharing snort-inducing images with all of you ;-)
Wow, it's been so long since I posted here. So much going on and so little time. In November DB became DH :) When he proposed it was quite a shock, especially since I had always labored under the impression he wanted to wait at least 3 more years before even getting engaged! But the wedding was beautiful and the best day of my life :) :)
On the whole the recipes have an emphasis on seasonality and local produce, are uncomplicated, and offer a selection covering every time of year. Hix makes it a point to feature lesser-known, more sustainable fishes such as Coley, Huss and Ling and also encourages foraging for those lucky enough to be near field or shore, with recipes like Seashore Salad and Fried Duck’s Egg with Spider Crab and Sea Greens. Aside from the egg shooters, I tried the Summer Vegetable Broth which was fresh, light and perfectly suited to the current spell of glorious weather. The silken quivering Elderflower and Buttermilk Pudding I trialed recently for a dinner party was equally summery and luscious.

Firstly, the result of a study published last year shows conclusively that the adult populations of US and Turkey are the least likely to believe in theory of evolution. The study was conducted over 34 countries which include Japan, US and 32 European nations. A question “Human beings, as we know them, developed from earlier species of animals.” was asked, in which correspondents could respond with true, false or unsure.
Modern syncretism takes many overt and covert forms, and encompasses–in my view–a wide variety of phenomena. Theories of difference and cultural diffusion (like those involved in Indo-European studies and which are its ultimate basis), migratory peoples, and tracing influences along trade routes, all have their roles to play in understanding how these various deities have developed historically. These are all matters which are known to and which are drawn upon by modern pagans and polytheists through the academic studies of these subjects. However, these studies do not account for the process theological mechanisms mentioned above, which would suggest that various deities like Zeus and Jupiter are not “ultimately one” and derive from a common source, so much as “separate developments” (whether from a common source or not) and separate individuals who may nonetheless have many family characteristics in common the way that siblings or even cousins can. The intersections and divergences in practical theology and devotion and the theories of scholars are matters that have been discussed in various places recently (including this very blog!), and the differences between these two areas should be kept in mind and respected. Just because a prevailing scholarly theory suggests that a particular deity “is” this or that or “comes from” here or there or “means” one thing or another does not necessarily mean this will have cultic relevance for a practitioner today; and likewise, just because a modern person’s understanding and perception of a deity indicates particular factors does not mean that such factors can–or even should be–proven academically, or should be the basis for confirmatory research. (The idea that “older = better = more authentic and therefore MORE RIGHT!” is a meme as common to paganism as to traditional academia; and whether this amounts to “my tradition has been handed down in secret for millennia” or “my devotion to this deity goes all the way back to when I was three years old,” the usual justification for these assertions is a degree of “rightness” over and above the questioning of others.) If we understand that syncretism and process theology have been operating on a level concurrent with whatever historical realities are observed and which can be reliably theorized upon, we will generally not be disappointed in our results.

Not that you embrace my ways as right for you, but that you are no longer irritated or disappointed with me for my seeming waywardness. And in understanding me you might come to prize my differences from you, and, far from seeking to change me, preserve and even nurture those differences.
Every morning, I wake up and ask this one question: when will Germany come to its senses and pull out of the euro? After all, Germany is the only real engine of the European Economic Community. Greece’s GDP…it’s less than 10% of Germany’s GDP.

Before his Ascension Christ affirmed that the hour had not yet come for the glorious establishment of the messianic kingdom awaited by Israel which, according to the prophets, was to bring all men the definitive order of justice, love and peace. According to the Lord, the present time is the time of the Spirit and of witness, but also a time still marked by “distress” and the trial of evil which does not spare the Church and ushers in the struggles of the last days. It is a time of waiting and watching.

Pursuing new interests, further developing passions, and setting goals. Three expressions of a creative heart that is realizing the world of writing has infinite possibility and can be encountered. I have set out to build a wordpress archive to practice describing life stories, expounding on my own thoughts and wonderment, and to learn how to write for children. The organization of my ‘blog’ will come together eventually, but for now its a melting pot of posts, links, quotes, and hopefully will not get to out of hand.

Well, I think that’s just about all I have to say about Cujo the movie. Except, I do believe I promised you earlier one last comparison to the book that was a major difference. So this would be the part where I yell “Spoiler Alert”, for both book and movie. In the book, despite Donna’s heroic effort at the end to kill Cujo and save Tad, it is all just a little too late. Tad has already died of dehydration. In the movie, after killing Cujo, Donna carried Tad into the house, splashed his face with water, performs mouth to mouth, and successfully brings Tad back from the brink of death. Apparently the young boy dying at the end was just a little too bleak even for this horror movie. And what makes this difference even more interesting is that, Stephen King himself was offered to work on the screenplay for the movie, but he turned it down because he felt it would have been too tempting of an opportunity to change everything he felt he got wrong in the book (and for someone who has no memory of writing the book, you can imagine there might be quite a bit to “fix” in his mind). And yet, even though King didn’t want to give in to the temptation to “fix” the story… Whoever ended up writing the screenplay still felt that the ending needed to be fixed…
How competitive are you? Do you know how to compete in the kingdom? Do you understand that being a part of the kingdom is about completing others rather than competing with others? ”I’m of Paul and another says I’m of Apollos” was the debate that went on among the Corinthians as they argued over who was their favorite apostle. I can imagine the debates, “Which apostle is more eloquent, who hears from God the best, who is the best teacher and of course who has the greatest anointing?” To that argument the Apostle Paul responds, “This attitude is carnal and not of God. None of us is more important than the other. Our focus should be to complete each other rather than compete with each other. God will reward each of us individually, according to each person’s labor and there is enough to go around.
But, alas, the black back-up singer has come back in the body of a young English girl as a lead singer who owns the world. Did she really record "21" when she was 21 years old? She's truly an old soul. Adele has touched so many people because of the emotion and pain she emotes in her songs. The melodies harken the soulful sounds of 60's and 70's and amplifies them with the rules of this decade.

Sunday was a fun day, we went to a church in Cochabamba where they spoke Spanish and only Spanish. Our house father who takes us where we need to go and helps us around sat next to me and translated a bit so I could at least understand what the sermon was about. I'm catching on to Spanish a little bit, it's easier for me to read and assoicate words with english even though they may not always be right. After that we just hung out at the house and played mafia with each other having fun and bonding.

Every situation is considered in terms of sensory demands on Mr. Sensitive – flickering classroom lights; overwhelming visual stimuli (kids moving around cleaning up); overwhelming auditory stimuli (the clean-up song and sound of toys crashing onto the shelf) – means that it is ok if Mr. Sensitive hides in a cubby hole while the rest of the kids clean up. Add the anxiety to sensory overload and you have a total meltdown. Although I will say that Mr. Sensitive does not have Autism (as far as we know, and he’s only been seen by half a dozen doctors); I completely emphasize with parents of kids with Autism. It is so frustrating to see the seemingly little things in the world wreak havoc with your child’s central nervous system and the resulting behaviour. Every parent wants to see their kid happy.
I talked to Verna tonight. Probably my best friend in this world. I enjoyed chatting about normal twenty something stuff. It is not often I get to do that and it was nice to take a break from the tragic, chaotic, damaging but beautiful world the majority of myself and my friends exist in. I wouldn’t loose these friends for the world but at times I become lonely for the few friendship I have known in my twenty-two years that were formed through the normal methods of becoming close to another human being. But yet it is also hard to explain the bond I have with the other girls. Perhaps it is only those who have lived the life we have can even begin to fathom it. An environment in which you come to know another person’s most private hurts and pain while you are struggling with your own cannot be replicated in the “outside” world. Friendships formed there are unlike any others. I really have no words to explain but perhaps that’s another post.
On Fridays Mum would give me the two half crowns wrapped in a bit of paper and the receipt to go to the shop on a corner in the Lambeth Walk. I collected the bundle wrapped in a white cotton cloth with a very big pin in the fabric to keep it closed. We had our clean clothes for Mass, altho my sleeves got very short (mum said I was growing too quickly) and we did have to keep them very nice. Sunday night the bundle was placed on the chair in the kitchen near the door so that I could not forget to take it with me in the morning on the way to school. Harvey and Thompson the pawnbroker did not open til 9.
Yes, it had 'art concepts' behind it. To me when I think of glam, I think of the Sweet and Gary Glitter, I don't think of Sparks. Glam rock was more about double tracked tom-toms and not much else going on.

One more thing that caught my eye in Jackson Heights was Kashmiri Tea. I was amazed to see its availability in New York, which I would have never imagined. “You will find everything in US but not Kashmiri tea, so take it along,” my Kashmiri-American friends advised me. But they were wrong, I could have saved a pound of my luggage, had I discarded their advice. Kashmiri Tea is actually salt tea that takes anywhere between four to six hours to make. Till date I have not been able to make Kashmiri tea, although I made a shorter version of it, sweet Kehwa. The availability of Kashmiri Tea in New York made me realize difference between America and New York. My Kashmiri-American friends are based in America and I was lucky to come to New York.

As illustrated above, 10 is by itself so it is 10. Then if we group the numbers so that each group equals ten, we have four additional sets. So all together, we have five groups of ten with five left over which equals 55. 5 x 10 = 50 + 5 = 55.

Roast chicken is one of those kitchen basics that I've never been able to master. Mine is usually passable, but often dry and flavorless. So Dorie's version, Roast Chicken for Les Paresseux- lazy people- was my choice this week for French Fridays with Dorie. The recipe was incredibly easy, and I'd have to say that it's as perfect for busy people as it is for lazy ones.

To conclude; the West’s sentimental attachment to the myth of the Noble Savage is irrational, to say the least. This feel good creation of the West’s, sometimes very naive, idealism is but another burden foisted on him on/in his quest to rationally approximate and understand the truth about this world we’ve been thrown into. Primitive societies are simply what they are namely, primitive. It is absolutely foolish of us to look to them for any guidance in an era which has long since disproved any claim to truth they could ever conjure up. And for us to employ the banal primitiveness of the Noble Savage to act as the conscience (as we did with Mandela!) to issue guilt for the perennial ‘sins’ (e.g. over-industrialization) we inevitably commit in/our quest to find the elusive answers to the questions that have made us the most progressive people on the planet, is even more idiotic. In short; the Noble Savage is dead!
We got to stay at the Doubletree in Del Mar. We have stayed there before for another trip and found the hotel to be nice, comfortable and affordable. I forgot to mention that they are dog friendly!!!

She puts in her prescriptions, and leaves, and it's our turn. But there's no one behind the counter. Another Army doctor/nurse guy comes, and looks like he's gonna do the same thing, so while we're waiting, Andrea tells him about the other guy, and was like "Yeah, he TOTALLY cut in front of us, and if that's help, I don't NEED help". The guy got the hint and waited patiently behind us - ROFL!
There are so many songs that remind me of Jordan, But one in particular would be Godspeed by the dixie chicks, just everything about this song has me in tears, "Godspeed little man, sweet dreams little man, oh my love will fly to you each night on angels wings" those words right there are enough to explain why =)
Greenan's first book It Happened in Boston? (1968) is something of a cult novel uniquely mixing the surreal, the absurd and the sinister in what has become his trademark in these rather hard to classify books. He went on to write several books each one utterly strange, utterly different. The Queen of America (1972) details the story of a couple of too smart for their own good teenagers, one of whom has a nasty habit of making tape recordings of his neighbors conversations, and the menacing female hitchhiker who becomes part of their lives. In Heart of Gold (1975), a story similar to Anthony Rolls' The Vicar's Experiment (aka Clerical Error), we learn of the life of a duplicitous, sometimes murderous, minister. Another story of antiques, theft and murder is The Bric-a-Brac Man (1976), a book which reveals Greenan's arcane knowledge of Japanese netsuke and the world of antiques in which he spent some time as a buyer and seller. Some of his latest fiction is now available via Smashwords. His work is vastly underrated and one of those rare writers who once sampled will be savored. I guarantee after reading any one of his books you'll be back for more.

I ordered this book a few weeks ago after I had seen it popping up all over the place. Tom always gives me a hard time when I buy books like this and says something like "Oh great, you spend money on a book about not spending money" and while I often laugh in agreement (there is something funny about buying things to tell you how to have less things) I don't regret the money I spent on this book for a second.
The sector continues to be hampered by the anemic pace of improvement in the labor market. There is certainly positive churn in leasing, but rents remain at levels last seen in 2007, and five-year leases coming due in 2012 run the risk of being signed at equivalent or lower rent levels, exerting a dilutive effect on landlord incomes.”
It was a firm message to all those people that argue that Biffy are as good as they've always been (aye right) and won't ever sell out. They did and the Many Of Horror incident proves it beyond any doubt, you could say they managed to Eradicate The Doubt. See what I did there?

At this point, I had also put together the shelf for the mail to sit on, but I don't have pictures of the process. I measured the length I wanted, and then cut a 2x4 and a 1x2 at that height.

I love the pendant, however, it made it really hard to figure out the art for the wall behind the pendant. It couldn’t be a single piece of art (I was planning on handing Court of the Fairies that’s in our office here) because the drum shade was right in the middle. But Jenny saved us once again when she posted about picture rails.
We talked a bit about how our disease impacts endodontistry and figured out that the anesthetic is what we needed to focus on. Dr. Gettleman not only explained (as I will in a paragraph or so), but showed me the book he based his decision upon and then lent the book to me so I could quote directly from it for this blog.
Julianne was at a birthday party. I'm starting to meet other parents. Our moods are improving greatly. We still hate the house, but that's another post for another day. Thing is, if we had won the lottery last month ~ Va would have been a distant bad memory and we'd have been back in Fla. If we won lotto today I guess we'd have to buy two houses. One here and one back in our lovely Florida ~ so we'd have the best of both worlds.
A few months ago I got an email from Liz in PR at Ben & Jerry's asking if I wanted to come up for VIP treatment at the Burlington Office.

After grabbing a hot chocolate from a nearby cafe, we decided to visit the Eiffel Tower again. Unfortunately we could not get to the summit of the tower as repair works were being carried out on the lifts but the views from the second floor was just as amazing! After the Eiffel Tower we headed back to Saint Paul's for lunch and some shopping. We found some amazing vintage shops and boutiques, as well as having Fallafel for lunch! We later headed to St Paul's where we found the best vintage, homeware, kitchenware and random shops in Paris, as well as seeing Notre Dame cathedral.

She also speaks like 5 languages......I give her hell whenever I see her. It keeps her grounded.
If Greece leaves the euro after it defaults, it can devalue its new currency, thereby stimulating demand and shifting eventually to a trade surplus. Such a strategy of “default and devalue” has been standard fare for countries in other parts of the world when they were faced with unmanageably large government debt and a chronic current-account deficit. It hasn’t happened in Greece only because Greece is trapped in the single currency.

I am never not happy at the sight of these flowers, either on the way to work or while running errands or just roaming around the city. In a city that has grown amazingly hot and dry, these flowers, along with the gulmohars, seem to provide a burst of cheery colour to soothe your frayed nerves.

That has been my life at work so far. I hate my job more than ever. I don't think I have ever gone from being completely indifferent about someone to extreme dislike so quickly. I'm desperately trying to find a new job. I thought about school, though I don't want to get a masters in my field, and I'm kind of liking the idea. I would really like to get a certificate/degree as a medical laboratory technician. It's something I thought about doing even as I entered college and it really appeals to me. Unfortunately, I can't find any local schools with that program, the closest being Colorado Springs or Denver (1+ hours away). There might be a school in Greeley (30 min away) with that program but I will have to look more thoroughly. I would really like to do online for at least a portion of the course if I can. It's a position with a lot of potential and I would start out making at least what I'm making now. I could take out more student loans (not ideal but necessary) and defer current student loans in repayment which would be helpful right now. I've set a deadline that I must find some jobs to at least apply to by the end of this weekend and/or have a list of schools that I want to apply to. I'm determined to get out of this job by the end of next month. It's not healthy for my currently emotionally unstable self to come home crying every day because of work. Ugh. Why can't life be easier?
The 'military occupation' nonsense is comical, since the majority of those who identify themselves as 'Palestinians' live under full 'Palestinian' control, in Gaza and in area C in Judea and Samaria. But putting that aside, from Mr. Areikat's statement I assume that he and the 'Palestinans' would thus have no problem whatsoever with Israel transferring those members of its population who identify as 'Palestinians' from Israel to their new reichlet, correct?

This is far from the X-ray of current-recession-era America that some of its champions claim it to be—but, taken as a romantic comedy-drama with never-fully-realized aspirations to topical relevance, it has its undeniable pleasures. George Clooney, as a frequent flyer whose profession is basically firing people, once again turns on the charisma (perhaps to the detriment of exploring the darker sides of his character). And Vera Farmiga, as his love interest, has never been more foxy onscreen—mostly because her previous directors (Martin Scorsese among them) have used her more for her ability to project desperation than Barbara Stanwyck-like sensuality. Folks, she had me melting in my seat!

What did I tell you. I told all nationalists on this blog what the election results for the BNP would be, and I also told Griffin, in my resignation e mail to him. Its all online, have a read of what I wrote. I could also define exactly how British Nationalism can rise again and what is required for us to start the movement moving into power, but until the present idiot leadership of all the 'Nationalist' parties are either removed or resign, then I will not detail how to do so. They dont deserve my ideas and support. The Nationalist movement in Britain is a pathetic disgrace. The primary fault lays not with the idiotic and incompetent 'leadership' of the parties, they are merely the symptom of the problem - the primary problem lays with the nationalists in the movement itself. Nationalists have become a cabal of pathetic cult of personality idiots, drones that can no longer act or think for themselves. They follow leaders who lie to them. They are willing slaves to liars, complicit in the crimes of their masters. They vote for the leaders in the parties and keep them in power, and hence they themselves are ultimately the real problem the movement has to face. Vote monkey, get monkey.

It should be noted that whites may well agree with blacks on both sides of sensitive issues, further evidence that the line between racism and racialism is in the process of being defined.
This weekend I obsessed over money, whether the gazillion products I'm using on my face are even making a difference, and this yellow split pea salad with cilantro pesto from Heidi Swanson's Super Natural Every Day. I gorged on it both yesterday and today and am fully prepared to gorge on it this entire month because it's that good.
Here is some background from luciferburns: After touring extensively all through 1977 and, for that matter, for the past five years, Robin Trower decided to take a break. No “live” shows were preformed in 1978 or 1979. That’s not to say he didn’t keep busy. His 6th solo release (not counting the “Live” album), “Caravan To Midnight”, was released in 1978. But no tours took place to promote “Caravan To Midnight”. And, to the best of my knowledge, no songs have ever been performed live from it to this very day!
But alas, we can. And we did. And I go into the car and find her smoking device and two zips of weed in the console and three roaches in the ashtray. I hold up the pipe. "This yours?"

Heat a stockpot or large oven over medium heat, add olive oil and when hot add the sliced garlic and 2 of the bay leaves. Cook until garlic in brown on both sides stirring all while. Remove garlic and bay leaves from the pot with a slotted spoon. Add the trinity (onion, celery, bell pepper) and sauté over medium-low heat until onion edges start to brown, about 6 to 8 minutes, stirring frequently to caramelize. Add the tomatoes cooking another 2 minutes.

I just used regular ol' paint brushes if I remember correctly, with all the grooves I decided to take the risk of brush marks since rolling would just be one more step. But brush marks really weren't so bad, they were barely visible, since we lightly sanded in-between each coat!
In January, I received an email from my principal announcing an opportunity to pursue a grant for summer travel and study aimed at invigorating, reshaping, or enhancing my teaching practice. I love to teach, and I love to travel, so I was immediately excited. After reviewing the materials provided by the granting agency, Fund for Teachers, I started thinking about what kind of trip might have the greatest impact for me and for my students.

Each town is blessed with its own brewery - Lambertville has the award-winning River Horse; New Hope has one of the popular Triumph Brewing locations. Both will be featured at one of the festival’s premiere events: the Sunday chili cook-off. Eleven eateries are competing this year, and ticket holders get to cast a vote for the People’s Choice Award. If chili is too hot to handle, head over to Triumph the previous day for the Rotary’s hot roast beef sandwiches, accompanied by brews and live music. Better yet, do both!

I figured I must be missing something, and thought surely they must have been popular for longer than I’ve seen, with a few more hits up their collective young sleeves, but nope. Looking over their Wikipedia page, they’ve got two big singles to their name, and that’s it. They appeard on the seventh season of The X Factor in the UK, originally as individual contestants in the “Boys” category, and this is an important point, were not good enough as individuals to make it through. It took former Pussycat Doll and all around moron Nicole Scherzinger to suggest that the five of them get together and enter the “Groups” category. Being young men and being captivated by her surgically enhanced rack, they took what she said on board.
I then went to my loyal Cricut and cut out a bright yellow vinyl sign that simply just said "Batman" to place in the middle of the graffiti. And now I'm hoping this "graffiti" can now be called "art"! :)

I know 3 girls who are currently pregnant with little boys and two who just had little boys so I've been sending a lot of baby gifts. Now unfortunately it's a little less fun to shop for baby boys because the selection is so limited. I always want to give something cute because its a baby... babies are cute, and the mommies are clearly girls. This is a perfect gift. Unlike a diaper cake it these are easily shippable ( I live far away from most of my friends who are expecting) and they are full of great stuff. Socks, Diapers, and Baby Wash Cloths. Not to mention they are just sooo cute! What a great gift idea!

(Quick technical note: the grenade launchers that each fire team has one of-- Fisher and Mahan-- are on carbines and can be shot at any time but go through the ready grenade process, therefore requiring a moment to reload. The Missile launcher is equipped by PFC Medina who carries a carbine as well. The Missile launcher is a development of the Javelin but targets can be painted by any soldier's helmet cam. It is twice the blast radius of a grenade and Impact 4/3 against HBA. It has only one shot and misses just deviate by 2d6".).

At Webster University’s Academic Resource Center there are endless ways a student can get help with anything and succeed in life. The bad thing is that not alot of students know about the center and the full capabilities it could provide. The A.R.C provides a writing center, a testing center, peer tutoring, technology counseling, and even academic counseling.

I would find a way to somehow speak my fill.”
When he was 13, he wanted to be a Catholic priest – so maybe his later porn career ironically turned out to be less sexually seedy than it might have done. And, in latter days, he bankrolled Mark Thatcher’s failed motor racing career. Perhaps as a thankyou, he was once invited to Downing Street by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as “an exemplary entrepreneur”.
But why did the lady who started her stint in power with slogans like “change, not revenge” and really surprised and pleased many with her initial civilised ways, reverse her approach so quickly and so decisively? Offering an apologia of sorts, one panelist in a televised discussion on the assault on the JU professor opined that her intolerance or angry reactions should be understood as an expression of the “hyper-sensitivity” of the first woman Chief Minister of West Bengal. Many, including some of her erstwhile supporters and admirers among the intelligentsia, have freely used against her invectives like madness, megalomania, fascist mindset and so on. It has also been observed that a deep-seated sense of personal insecurity lurks behind the CM’s overreaction to criticism.
Humanity Healing Community acts as one of the new world’s wayshowers in suggesting that the arrival of the Lammas/New Moon/Fifth Day is even more potent because as a point in consciousness — it encourages us to choose actively how we want our new world to be.
Place eggs in a small pot / saucepan and fill up with water until eggs are submerged. Place on the stove and heat until water comes to a boil. Use a spoon to move the eggs around occasionally so that the yolks stay in the centre of the egg. Let it boil for about 3-5 minutes. The eggs should be semi-hard-boiled. Turn off the flame, discard the water and place the eggs in bowl of cold tap water to let them cool. Using the back of a tablespoon, tap the eggshell all over to create cracks that are deep enough without the shells breaking off in pieces.
The beauty of these portfolios is that they are all made using a single piece of latigo leather and are secured with two hand-hammered copper rivets, thus no glue or stitches were used. Each portfolio is cut, burnished, folded, stamped, riveted and oiled, one at a time, entirely by hand and built in-house in L.A.. Given that they are made from premium leather, the leather will soften over time and continuous use will give it a nice patina. They are available in various sizes, though the standard size, priced at about $150, is designed to fit a stack of letter-size paper. Other sizes include an extra large portfolio that can fit a 17″ MacBook pro, a smaller iPad-size folio and a small folio that’ll fit a book. You can also contact the designer directly for a custom order.
1. Secondary care doctors must look to their local community. It is naïve to think that a hospital only serves those patients that happen to be in the clinic, or on the wards. Hospitals, if they wish to truly serve the public, which funds them, must look outside their walls, to the community. We cannot sit on the inside of ivory towers complaining about the standard of care given in the community for patients with our particular illness, and do little or nothing to change that care. This is “population medicine” – concern for the wider population, not just the referred population. With limited resources, we need to be sure that specialists are seeing specialist cases, not just whoever happens to turn up. Only through collaboration in networks or systems of care will we achieve this.

Merriam Webster’s definition of repent is to turn from sin and dedicate oneself to the amendment of one’s life; to feel regret and contrition; to change one’s mind. Repentance allows entrance into the Kingdom of God where abundant resources resides to insure that we make our long journey and cross over to the other side…eternal life.
And what of the third, fourth and fifth parties: the Greens, Liberals and Tories? As the first graph appearing above records, of the three the Conservatives attracted the most first preferences in wards, but only (and only just) saw a single councillor elected to the five each won by the Liberals and Greens. One interesting and significant point of detail: the wards where a party sees a councillor returned do not neatly align with their best first preference performances. For example, the Greens currently have a councillor for Canal ward (on 703 first preference votes) and Southside Central (812), but not a sausage in Langside or Pollokshields, in which they polled initially much more strongly.
On the morning of Friday, February 17, 2012, I wired my son and sent him to school. That night, when I listened to the audio my life forever changed, for I heard my son being bullied by his teacher and aide.”
I also like his emphasis on the importance of having a support culture in your critical reflection, that teaching should be something that is talked about and worked on just like we expect our students to talk about their learning and academic work. The sense of a learning community among teachers very much appealed to me, although Brookfield is quick to point out that there are severe risks involved in becoming sufficiently vulnerable to engage in significant conversations about this sort of stuff. You have to admit you’ve done things wrong, or are confused about a dynamic in your classroom, or don’t know what to do in a certain situation. In certain academic cultures, that’s the blood in the water. Critical reflection is a dangerous thing, because it rocks the boat – which is why you need a trusted community to be part of.

As many of you know, we have 11 Hooligans. 9 hens, 2 roosters We knew going into this, that 2 roosters might be too many, but we weren't willing to get rid of any. Unfortunately until we do something about a rooster, the girls are paying the price. Optimal is one rooster per 12-20 hens. Our other issue is the Buckeye roosters are enormous, they run right around 9 lbs, and the hens at around 4-5 lbs.
The London Lucumi Choir (“Lucumi” is a Cuban variation of the word “Ulkumi” or “Ulcumi”, one of the former kingdoms in Yorubaland) was founded in 2006 and is one of the few community ensembles in the British capital that doesn’t audition future members. The choir is the brainchild of percussionist Jorge Amando de Armas Sarria, singer and arranger Daniela Rosselson de Armas and master drummer Javier Campos Martínez. The group focuses mainly on performing songs dedicated to the orishas (Yoruba deities), plus other rhythms belonging to the rich Afro-Cuban tradition. The London Lucumi Choir was recently shortlisted for the Folkloric Act of the Year by online magazine Latino Life. It will officially launch Un Solo Palo No Hace Monte on the 24th April at the Rich Mix as part of the La Línea Festival.

Maintaining Patience as it All Comes Together
Now, let me begin by saying that if you don’t have any education at all in the topic of Earth & space science, astronomy, physics, and what-have-you that I can understand an almost blind acceptance of geocentrism for one simple reason: it certainly appears that everything in the sky moves around the Earth. Look in the sky and you’ll see the Sun, Moon, planets, stars, etc all moving – from your frame of reference – around the Earth.
I am here to stand with you and say we all have doubts, we all have moments of uncertainty, your joining the likes of Moses, David, Abraham, Peter and more, just as God used their doubt to bring new levels of spirituality, he will use your doubt for good.
And it must go.
Constantine was the first Christian Roman emperor who saw the symbol of Christ at the battle of the Milvian Bridge. Long before York was known as Jorvik to the Vikings’, Constantine would have known the city by its Roman name, Eboracum.
And they're good people, too, not narcissistic bastards like some aging stars can become. During the show, a fan waved a copy of their first album. Guitarist Gibbons waved the man up to the stage, chatted with him a minute or so, and then all three of the band members autographed it. Then he pretended to auction it off, talking fast and sounding for all the world like a real auctioneer -- "OK, the bidding starts at $1000, over here do I hear $1000, $1000 over here.... Nah, I'm just kiddin'!" And he gave the album back to the fellow, to loud applause.
Do you ever think off what to do with the extra tomato and chillies sauce (in packet) after having your KFC ? Yes here goes into the sweet and sour sauce! Great idea from my in-law. Well it is alright to use the tomato sauce from bottle :) I omit the chili sauce as my kids can't take heat.

While we were at Lake Powell last month, we stopped at the Walmart in Page. I noticed that they had an entire case of green chiles for only $10.00! I bought one the night before we came home because I never ever seen them sold by the case up here, and they would certainly cost more than that.

First I painted the drapery with a copper colored acrylic. I used a Sargent Art acrylic paint that I purchased from Dick Blick. I got a nice little selection in an all in one type deal for $5 but it looks like they aren't selling them like that anymore. These bigger single bottles look like they are the same thing and still a good value. That is real copper wire next to the paint in the picture above for comparison, it's a perfect match. I used copper paint, teal acrylic and some gesso to make my patina.
Companies that can quickly implement changes that successfully address employees’ reasons for leaving may be able to increase staff retention while attracting employees from competitors. In the current environment where employee turnover rates can range from 10 percent to 40 percent, improving retention alone can create a competitive advantage for an organisation.
The world now knows, I'm engaged! You've seen the pics, you've watched the video and probably saw the ring... If you havent', here's the story.
It was only many years later, when I actually began my initial piano lessons with a spinsterish fifty-something Italian woman, that I got an actual aesthetic and musical response to my "jazz preaching". Once I brought Francesca my new copy of Sarah Vaughn's HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON with Oscar Peterson and my piano teacher proceeded to go over to the piano and, after but a single initial hearing, copy Peterson's lines off of the record, (at least the ones she could execute technically). She called doing that having "perfect pitch" and, whatever that was, I knew then that I didn't have it, let alone relative pitch. It would take decades for me to develop my ears through arduous labyrinth and torturous travels on my part. (It didn't help that the music teachers around me, especially Francesca, were adamantly opposed to playing by ear. This struck me as the grossest hypocrisy because Francesca had this marvelous ability to play an Oscar Peterson line with little effort on the spot and I bet she enjoyed it too. However there was this dogma about sight reading and the sanctity of the written score, a kind of fetish in the classical music world in my particular environment.

In the few years I have lived on this planet; in what the pious claim: my physical form, for the greater part of my being is of a metaphysical nature, I have come to question this idea of culture we have grown within our midst. Maybe I don’t speak for all of the islands of the Philippines, for within the various niches, individual identities differing from the monotony may exist, however, as I continue to reside in my own area, I take it as it comes.

Throw in the awesome new songs, and the superb cover medley, and there was enough to get everyone in the crowd going. There were smiles on everyones faces, and it was a brilliant thing to see. They’re totally worth catching live if you get the chance.

Basically this means, that new people are joining and staying. Apparently, when anyone joins, the server score is deducted 15 points, then for every minute they stay, the score gets incremented by 1 up to a maximum of 1 hour. The whole system intends to weight itself towards busy, well-run community servers to try and ensure that new players experience the best of TF2. So from that alone, our Server should do well. We have our seeding core of Clan and community players and, as well as new players, when the server is full, we have our more experienced regulars dropping in and out to give them a proper flavour of the game. And we’re seeing regulars who haven’t played for a while, stopping by for a couple of maps, easier now the server is staying full which is a great outcome.

She went to the gym to vent. Jae Ha was there and saw a dejected Hang Ah. As she was running, she lost step and fell. Jae Ha noticed she was crying and easily asked who was the cause of it. Like friends, they talked and Jae Ha gave her comforting words. Sweet. Funny how Hang Ah said she does not have high standards in men but started to rumble about her ideal mate. After hearing it all, Jae Ha then approached her closely, as if reaching out to her for real. He told her that guys are nuts since for him Hang Ah is a woman. Smooth dude. Jae Ha then started to touch her hand and looked at Hang Ah’s eyes deeply.. Is he about to kiss her? OMO! Then again, it wasn’t gonna end in that direction.

Anyway, something has really struck me. This latest surge in popularity for Dystopian novels has been a fun thing. Well, you should read this book if you like that sort of stuff. Because guess what, we've had plenty of dystopias in the PAST. I totally feel like I'm reading a book about the future, where an evil government has taken away all of your rights and identity and what makes you unique. Where people live in daily fear of being arrested at a whim.

Four Dyslexia Centres on the Isle of Wight are to be closed by the IW County Council. The direct teaching service currently being delivered at these centres will discontinue. Responsibility for pupils with specific learning difficulties (SpLD) will move into Island classrooms. Schools will be given the funding to train classroom teachers to support dyslexic children within mainstream eductation. One part-time Dyslexia Centre teacher who will be made redundant has decided to work directly with schools and parents. Sarah Luke believes one-to-one direct teaching is more beneficial as it is her area of expertise. However, she does not explain how this will be achieved. Will funding be available for her to be employed by the schools? If not then parents only remaining option is to hire her to work with their child.

So, here's my first thought-blog: when it's on a cob or in a can, corn is a vegetable. Does that mean that when it is popped it's still a vegetable? It was, after all, once corn kernel, right? If that's the case it's time for my nightly vegetable with a good movie since the kids are in bed. (And by "in bed" I mean they are playing with their trains and NOT sleeping quietly - they are 5 and 3 with minds of their own).

Now they collided with Jesus on this often in the New Testament and people saw it. They could tell by watching Jesus that He was bringing something new to the table in relationship with God; that there was something different about Jesus’ holiness and righteousness that was not like the Pharisees.

I’ve heard an expression: “Some people are so heavenly-minded, they are no earthly good.” I detest that expression. It is entirely false. I have never met anyone who is too heavenly-minded. And the most resurrection-oriented people I know are the ones who have done the most for the Lord and for their fellow human beings here and now. It is only when we lost sight of resurrection that we become focused on making ourselves happy here and now, whatever the cost.

If someone is not a Christian, and is involved in homosexual activity, chances are that no amount of preaching is going to change their mind. Their position is fostered by the sinful nature which dwells within, and from which, without Christ, they have no escape. To them, homosexuality is just a lifestyle, whether they believe it is the way they were born, or it is a choice. Society has accepted this stance as well and just serves to nurture their belief that there is nothing wrong with what they are doing. For this reason, the primary goal should be to reach these people with the gospel of Christ. Until and unless they receive the Lord, they will have no reason to seek to change. So proclaiming the gospel to these people is the most loving thing we can do for them.
Philip Pullman wrote in a shed, before his huge success with His Dark Materials enabled him to buy a house with an indoor study. Many of my writer friends have sheds; Linda Strachan calls hers Tuscany. When Pullman moved house he gave his to a writer-illustrator friend, who demolished and reconstructed it in his own garden. It even still had plot post-its adhering to the walls.

I chose "Swiss Coffee" since it's almost a white white, but just shy of it. I didn't want it to be so crazy white that it felt stark or clashed with the rest of the house. And I went with a satin sheen again, just as I did with the kitchen cabinets.

One thing she is not thinking about is having an affair, but the neither is Jonas. Jonas is also not having fun. He also had expectations, had made plans. Now he only has wants:
One example is Henry C. Roberts, whose The Complete Prophecies of Nostradamus saw print in 1994. After careful study of the quatrains, Roberts came to believe that Nostradamus had infallibly predicted a dramatic event in the near future: the election of Edward Kennedy as president of the United States. (You’ll find this prediction on pages 210 and 218 of Roberts’ book.) Any chance Roberts might have had at a reputation for infallibility went away when Kennedy died in 2009, having never gotten closer to the White House than a failed 1980 run for the Democratic nomination.
I like her because she always looks like she's having the time of her life on stage, in her videos, in interviews, basically during anything that has to do with her music. Seeing that kind of passion is inspiring, I think, especially since we all know that life isn't ever that much fun, and pursuing creative endeavors is especially scary. I find it enjoyable to watch someone who's having that much fun, and is so positive. (Not that I wouldn't have fun being Taylor Swift!)

As of Monday, MOH and I have been sticking to putting the kids down at 8:30. This has been a real lifesaver for me because I can get most of my work done before midnight now. (This is prepping notes for the next day at school and stuff like that.) If I keep being this productive I might actually get the taxes done early this year. Not holding my breath though.

And? Well, I'd call it cute and completely forgettable, except perhaps for the loveliness of Marion Cotillard as everyone's love interest and the outrageousness of Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali. The best performance by far was by Paris herself; the images of the city were picture postcard perfect and I really had to resist saying, "I've been there! And there! And there!" And so while the script, even with its flights of fancy, is predictable, I'm guessing that you'll still leave with a smile on your face. If you're not in Paris, you might be figuring out how to get here at any cost. And for those of us who are? Well, it was a good reminder to go out and take a midnight stroll through the city, something that beats the price of admission even when it's on special.
I don’t usually get into all the voting etc. but think this is an awesome opportunity…….if you get a chance (or have a free 5 seconds), click on the link above and vote for my blog…..If you like the things I create and find them helpful, I’d love for you to consider voting! You can vote each day until November 8th. I won’t pester you any more about it after today (as I’m also not into begging) ……..it’s all a bit of fun :-)

As every student of Plato knows, if something has a relation to the soul it has a relation to the city. Thus if our theory is anything more than the smoke it purports to explain, it can be used to analyze political phenomena. For example, in recent years we have witnessed a concerted effort to sterilize our erotic attachments, to sap them of their danger but also of their vigor. The flat, unerotic words we now use for these attachments confirm this. Instead of “lover” and “beloved,” we now have “significant other” and, even worse, “partner” (a term which lends to the affairs of the heart all the excitement of filling out a tax form). Given this environment, it is no wonder that our most vigorous moral war waged today is against cigarette-smoking. Nor is it any wonder that this war’s only rival in intensity is the one in favor of “safe sex,” for condoms sterilize sex not only literally but figuratively as well.

According to the Muslim belief, the forces to battle the one eyed beast would rise from the area of Khurasan that comprises of portion of Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and part of Central Asia. If the anti-Christ forces have assembled in Afghanistan, it’s not a coincidence but well thought out Zionist strategy to take on Pakistan, the nuclear power of the Muslim world so its free to advance other Muslim territories without any fear.
I am that Dad. I am that Dad who goes swimming when he is tired, because he knows that he'll get more energy as soon as he hears his children's laughter. I am that Dad who makes a hot dog smothered with bacon and pepperoni at 2:00am, because it's what sounds good to his child right now. I am that Dad who will sit in a coffee shop and play Monopoly for three hours or until I lose, whichever comes first, because when I can be patient I can learn new ways to have fun. I am that Dad who goes to three stores to find their favorite ice cream when they lose one too many rounds of Mario Kart, because ice cream heals more tears than words do. I am that Dad who says "yes" when my youngest wants to buy a zippo, because he really isn't very likely to burn down anything too important. I am that Dad who can wipe a butt with a smile, because wiping it with a frown sucks for both of us. I am that Dad who is never perfect, but who tries his best every day to stay connected with his life, because I am not perfect and have no desire to pretend to be so. I am that Dad who is honest and real, despite my warts, because my kids will all have warts and I want them to grow up without fearing them. I am that Dad who is unafraid to sing loudly with the windows open because life should be celebrated in freedom; who is willing to have his toenails painted, because all little girls need to be able to paint outside the lines; who will wrestle seven kids at once in a public park, because it's okay to get a public ass-whooping every now and again; and who speaks in his Monty Python voice while walking through a nice restaurant, because people are way too fucking stuffy and I don't want my kids to think that they have to be that way when they grow up. I am the Dad who loves my kids enough to question the status quo behind everything from our education system to traditional parenting styles to my own abilities and struggles, because my kids deserve that and so much more. I am the Dad who cries at certain commercials, because certain commercials are touching and we all need to recognize the value of a good cry. And I am the Dad who knows that he doesn't know best about much, except for about the fact that his partner and kids are simply amazing. I am THAT Dad.
For those of you that are confused- I managed to get myself "in the family way" again. You'd think I'd learn what causes that after having 3 others, but I guess I'm a slow learner.
The torn tights and bruised knees didn’t spell quite the same damage as the time I wore my grandmother’s mink stole. ”Is that real fur?” enquired a guest at the bijou drinks do. “Was,” I retorted apologetically. Let’s just say the spirit of Christmas, much like my furry accessory, was not alive that night. Had I stayed at home in my fleece pyjamas watching George Michael warble to ‘Last Christmas’, I would have fared better. At least the house has an alarm.

Deceptively creepy love song that starts devotional and ends kind of medical - there's multiple references to skin and teeth in among the fey.
I shall build up my strength in union with The Lord and by means of His mighty power, putting on all the armour that God has given me, so that I will be able to stand up against the devil’s evil tricks. So I stand ready, with Truth as a belt right round my waist, with Righteousness as my breastplate, and as my shoes the readiness to announce the Good News of Peace. At all times carrying Faith as a shield; for with it I will be able to put out all the burning arrows shot by the evil one. And I shall accept Salvation as a helmet, and the Word of God as the sword which The Spirit has given me, to God’s glory in Christ Jesus! Amen!

Students and scholars of the Fourth Gospel should feel indebted to Carter for making Rome visible in the narrative in a way that reflects the realities of life under Roman rule. He is correct in his assertion that Johannine scholars have long overlooked Rome’s presence in the narrative. Further, his argument is immersed in a strong awareness of Roman political and societal issues as well as a breadth of secondary literature, and these strengths will surely open new vistas for those interested in Rome as it relates to NT studies. Nevertheless, despite the valuable contributions that can be mined from the margins of his work, Carter’s main thesis is problematic for several reasons.
The other day I saw a shrew. It was a fleeting glimpse, barely a few moments, and such a tiny creature - which leads me to think it was a pygmy shrew - that had I blinked I'd have missed it. At the time I didn't give it much thought (believe it or not I was looking for snakes), but afterwards I began to consider it more carefully.
The basic process of making and transporting soup and its ingredients hasn’t changed that much over the last 46 years. The trucks are now refrigerated, bigger, and more efficient. Technology directs the process today. Produce is no longer raised on the Texas Panhandle but it still comes from American farms. I can’t pretend that the carrots in the soup are from our farm but I’m happy to know some American farm children can still make that claim.

Second, do you encounter them from a position of strength or weakness? Now, in some ways, plunking a human down in the age of dinosaurs is automatically a position of weakness. But there’s the possibility that the characters could go well-equipped, with all kinds of modern technology and guns and armored personnel carriers and whatnot. But in that case, you have to make the technology somehow fail, anyway…
Then I got "Snicker Snocker" that was a vanilla cake with a snicker center topped with a vanilla buttercream rolled in snicker pieces.

This is a by-product of the ‘science fictionization’ of zombies, primarily. If we want to stick with necromancers chanting foul rituals to raise hordes of the undead, I have no problem with the concept whatsoever. By dint of involving magic, you are consciously waving away any and all of the concerns I voice below. However, science fiction, as the first word indicates, needs to pay a certain homage to science as we understand it. It can bend and stretch the rules of physiology just so far before an idea ceases to be plausible and, therefore, becomes ridiculous. The science fiction zombie is one such entity.

But I’ve mentioned it here just to see if the magic of social media and search really does get through to the people who have the power to change these things.

The Internet, or 'Net', stands for Interconnection of Computer Networks. It is a massive conglomeration of millions of computers and smartphone devices, all connected by wires and wireless signals. Although it started in the 1960's as a military experiment in communication, the Net evolved into a public free broadcast forum in the 70's and 80's. No single authority owns or controls the Internet. No single set of laws governs its content. You connect to the Internet through a private Internet service provider, a public Wi-Fi network, or through your office's network.

Not unlike childbirth, the ice bath is one of those uncomfortable experiences that you remember as painful, but cannot quite conjure the extremity of it until you do it again. Yesterday afternoon I filled my tub with cold water, filled a large pitcher with ice, made a cup of hot peppermint tea and grabbed an oversized hoodie. At this point I ask that you do your best not to picture me naked, but if you must, please note that when nude I look surprisingly like Angelina Jolie sans tattoos. I stayed clothed from the waist up in a tank top and that warm hoodie. I set my tea on the edge of the tub, knowing it would warm me from the inside out. I stuck one foot in the tub and then stood there--it was a painful shocking sensation- as if I stepped barefoot into a snowbank. I pulled my other foot off of the floor and went to submerge it but I just couldn't. I just stood there balanced on one foot like a flamingo. Every time I went to put my foot into the water it was if it had a mind of its own--there was no way it was going in. I probably could have stood in that position for hours, but let's face it, I had just run 13 miles (14 if you include the mile we ran just to get to the start line) and there was no way I could balance like that forever. Finally I gave in and stood with both feet in the cold, cold water. I thought about frostbite, and stupidity and the fact that I was an idiot for trying. I stood there for about five minutes when I finally became brave enough to sit....

So now Terri comes to stay with me from Monday through Thursday or Friday, depending on the week. I was pretty nervous about having another person in the house again, but Ry LOVES Terri. It has only been a couple days so far, but Ry already seems to be benefitting from her new ability to sleep without being woken up at 6:30. Terri is working on potty training, and she has a carseat so she can take Ry to story time at the library, Cosi, the zoo, the store, and play dates with her sister-in-laws kids. Even more beneficially, Ry and I are getting more time together because we can hang out in the morning some before I got to work and earlier in the evening because we're not just getting home at 6:00. So far, so good. Was it worth the consequences? In the long run, probably.
The question, however, is whether the revolution that Jesus came to initiate has reached into your heart and mine. No matter how long you have been a disciple of Jesus, there are parts of the revolutionizing of your heart and mind that have yet to be realized. Ask the Spirit for the power to change and not to resist.

When you factor in the ownership of many regional brewers as family businesses, the future brewing operation looks even more bleak. It is no longer the done thing to hand over the business to the eldest male, heterosexual, stable, married, male child producing child. The shareholding is split between all children, then between all their children and so on. Each generation dilutes the shareholding and introduces shareholders with no interest in the business. Some may have an interest in joining the family business, others may wish to sell up, mortgage their shareholding for the capital to go do their own thing or simply secure a liveable level of dividends for a cushy life. As one generation passes to another the chances increase of a none family member taking the helm. Somebody that knows how to run a business rather than somebody that contains some of the DNA of the dead guy that started it, someone with an MBA and a CV, someone whose job it is to deliver dividends from the current business and seek new business rather than maintain what used to be the business but is now only an historical legacy of the founders. Someone who asks “why the hell are we running an expensive brewery when we make all our money out of a regional chain of restaurant pubs flogging hot diners and bottles of Pinot Grigio?”

Amber kept shaking it, trying to clear the weird dull feeling and get her mind into order. How did she know this man? The knowledge she sought shifted and evaded her grasp, as though it was a living thing and could anticipate her. The haze in her head lifted long enough that she saw the silver-haired man clearly at last. His eyes were cold as he stared into hers, pupils narrowed and an edge of darkness about his handsome face.

Seems fitting, doesn’t it? It is the digital, information age after all.

In other life, there is a little bit of work to do, and schemes to hatch. I've given up worrying about why I play my crazy harmonicas with people, young or old. I must like to play, and I must think I am good at whatever it is I do. Lately I've been trying to broaden the scope a bit. Oddly that can involve knowing when not to play or when to lay back. I thought I was good at that, but I am noticing I am getting better at it. That is because I am listening to my judgement more on it and not that of others. People tend to want you to play too much or too little on songs. They just don't know best.

This is not just a question of taste. It seems to me that the real purpose of stories and reading is to take you out of yourself and put you somewhere else. Anything that is made to be sold to a particular demographic, however, will always end up reflecting the superficial concerns of that demographic. Exactly: books are for stretching you, growing you, educating you - for adults, too, which is why I've always questioned any publishing marketing philosophy based on the notion of simply catering for an already established need, of which the proposed age-banding is just the latest form. Simon Juden, chief exec of the Publishers Association is being disingenuous when he argues for it as a philanthropic gesture towards children and their parents: 'We don't want a child not to be bought a book as a present because the adult doesn't know where to start'; and it is depressing that critics of the 'No to Age-banding' campaign on the Guardian books blog appear to have swallowed this wholesale and in their clamorous endorsement of such 'help' for parents have revealed a regrettably blinkered - if not I'm-alright-Jack - view of the matter of children and reading:

I mentioned it to my daughter and she said her boyfriend had complained about the same problem.
About an hour or so after I got there, I glanced in the parking lot and saw my ex boyfriend Jered walking up. I may have mentioned before that he played rugby with my brother, so I pretty much knew he'd be there, and had prepared myself. Funny thing is, he actually PLAYED on the team, and I didn't of course, but everyone preferred to hang out with me at the bar and took my side on the whole breakup. THAT's pretty damn cool if you ask me. He looked so out of place and uncomfortable, and Steph and I kept giggling about it all night. La-hooo, za-herrr.

When I walked in, I was greeted by 15 children scattered around the room quietly engrossed in different activities. Some were on the floor with Montessori learning tools neatly spread out on little rugs. Others (including Little S) were sitting at tables around the room working on numbers, shapes, colouring, pouring activities, painting, and various other things.
Slowly the story emerged. He had come half an hour late from office. tired, drained and tensed about his job and the recession which had affected many people around him. A volley of accusations, abuses and a cordless telephone hit him before he could realize what was happening. What followed was a frenzy which left him completely worn out and isolated.
My lunch partner's starter of mussel and saffron soup was decent enough, but my bland autumn vegetable "cook pot" came with a side order of worm. Yes, you heard me right. The attitude of the staff was very "har har har, more protein for you". Nice. It happens I know.

This week was good, I had sales school with my company and we learned a LOT. It really blew my mind, but I was glad to walk out of that training room on Friday afternoon because my friend YJK and I were headed to the symphony downtown. It was so super amazing to watch, and the talent of all those people was just amazing.

Zombie Tag is about decisions. It is about right ones, wrong ones, and dealing with the ones you have made. For that reason I believe anyone can benefit from reading this story. You can't go wrong here. The characters are so true to what children are and what they believe. Though Zombie Tag deals with many BIG issues some parents try to hide from their kids, I believe the story deals with them in a way children can understand.
Boy #1 continues to be homeschooled, but blends his home education with two formal classes at school (Integrated Language Arts and Science), vocal lessons, show choir, acting and fishing. He also writes for an outdoors website, hookandbullet.com. He, too, seems generally content with his educational arrangement.
*UPDATE on the decals* - Mike e-mailed me that he sent out another set of decals and I should receive it before Friday. btw, Mike has a cool website (I spent over an hour reading it).

The best thing about our dinner tonight....none of it came from a can or the grocery store shelf! We had sausage biscuits, eggs and water! The sausage and eggs we got from our local farmers market this past Saturday and the biscuits were homemade!! That was exciting for us and we're hoping to be able to plan more meals like this in our future! Well, it's almost midnight so I better hit the sack! Thanks for stopping by and let me know if you're working out and how it's going. Any farmer's market trips that you've been on lately?

Still, the intellectual assent and emotional exaltation of the worshipper in the presence of the holy are not required to give the effect we’re discussing its power. The contemplation effect is remarkably independent of the other activities of the mind, and in particular, it works regardless of the thoughts and feelings you associate with the object of contemplation. One of the more bitterly ironic narratives in recent American history shows this independence in action.
With each new enterprise came a new level of success, and with Kukl, Björk and her future Sugarcube partners Einar and Siggi achieved a degree of international recognition. This resulted in two albums, "The Eye" and "Holidays In Europe (The Naughty Naughty)", being issued, via the anarchist Crass label, in the U.K.
I know that I’m beating a dead horse here, but watching a certain show for the sake of pretension doesn’t make one better than anyone else. If that is the case, then Strike Witches would be a masterpiece. It would be revered for its story about the feminization of war, and its undertones of world peace. But because it consist mostly of moé characters and the fact that they are “not wearing any pants,” it is considered “fanservice crap” in the eyes of the western fanbase. Madoka Magica would get a lot more praise than it already has for giving a dark new take on the magical girl genre. However, it still gets a lot of hate for what it is, and is dismissed for having “underage girls.”
So while other local groups come and go like the proverbial wind, or consistent groups made up of an open door “temporary players” situation seem to struggle to carry on from one week to the next, here I sit somehow blessed with a great group made up of four of us who have been there the entire three years, and three of us who are now on their (more or less) two year anniversary of play, well, what can I say? Sure, I bitched about some of the power/meta-gaming here and there (mostly because I was not used to being around it, these were mostly seasoned gamers compared to my 90's groups), but now we are used to each other and our particular peccadillo's. We know what we can get away with, and what we probably should not try to get away with unless you are Dan Dan The Power Game Man(tm). And it there is a certain security in the fact that we have to turn down at least one person a month who wants in the group because we are at maximum occupancy.
Yes, that’s the cover of my latest novel. I think it’s awesome, and I hope you agree.

She turns to see a large central terminal, a circular table with deep red light glowing from a central shaft reaching up to the canopy of the ceiling. The table has a multitude of transparent structures, rigidly carved and jutting from both top and bottom surfaces of the tabletop. Just slightly to the right of the central shaft, she sees the woman, basking in the radiance. She looks at the woman carefully, and notes something about her; a face she thinks she’s seen somewhere before.

Because of a decades-old treaty with Mexico prohibiting building in the Rio Grande floodplain, the government built its border fence more than a mile north of the snaky river, trapping tens of thousands of acres of Texas–land in Cameron and Hidalgo counties–on the wrong side of the fence. The border wall is also riddled with miles-long gaps, seemingly placed at random. The U.S. Border Patrol says that illegal crossers are pushed to these gaps, where they are more easily apprehended.

In the end though, I wasn't satisfied with the cake. Even though all the components for boston cream pie were there, it just tasted like a yellow cake with chocolate frosting. I thought that it needed more pastry cream, and the cake was not as moist as I wanted it - I probably need to make more adjustments to my baking time for the 6-inch pans, as I only decreased the time by 5 minutes.

I just have one random thought this week: I wish I could sing.
After having a great weekend with Christian friends things are on a high for a while and then down the next week. I'm reminded now of the song "Party"! Good times here on earth are just a reminder of what it'll be up there. So for now, let's enjoy the good times we have and if anyone is struggling, just hold on and God will provide. "Oh the answer will come but only in His time, stand still and let God move".
I am committed to my goal, but what's happening here may well weave itself in a highly fictionalized form into my story.

Growing up we never ate beets in our household, it was just one of those vegetables that my mom never cooked for dinner. Daikon, natto, gobo root- sure...beets? Nope. So, my first encounter with beets didn't come until I was well into college and unfortunately it wasn't on a plate...it was in a diaper. A rather full and overflowing diaper at that. Let me back up a bit.
I did not follow up with the consultant to schedule a party or make an order, but I never completely forgot about Thirty-One either. I really wanted one of their “skirt purses” that allow you to change the look of your purse without having to transfer all of the contents. You buy either a black or a brown purse and choose a free “skirt”. You can then purchase additional “skirts”.

This one is mercifully simple. Lets say Pisces is rising. So the lord of the first house is Jupiter. If Jupiter is in a good house, this is a positive factor. It means the First House will be positive – you will have a good body and good material success.If on the other hand Jupiter is in a bad house, it is a negative indication – you will not be so pretty or sound in body and will lack in material success.
On Monday my mom, daughter and I went to the Wildhorse Resort and Casino for a little gambling at the slots. Wish I could say we all came away big winners but that just wasn't the case. We did each bring back a little of what we took to gamble with so as not to make the day a total bust. I had some people coming in to the casino snap a photo of us before we headed back home.

And what shall I say of the most Holy Father, the pope? Is it not true that he and his bishops have become worldly lords, have fallen away from the Gospel, led by the spirit of lies, and embraced their own human doctrine, and thus have practiced murder, down to the present hour? Read the histories of the time and you find that the principal business of popes and bishops has been to set emperors, kings, princes, lands, and people against one another, even themselves to fight and help in the work of murder and bloodshed. Why so? Because the spirit of lies never acts any other way.

Even though cost could be an element of your choice, you would also have to look at the quality of treatment. What unique competencies do the veterinarians have? Will web reviews of the veterinarian reflect that other people’s pets received outstanding care? Getting referrals from those who may have taken their pets to a particular veterinarian could also be beneficial. Learning about the type of treatment your family pet could receive is really a must prior to looking for treatment from a veterinarian. Really, you never want to be in the dark about the manner of care your pet would receive.
I'm sure most of you are familiar with the Baby Einstein videos and have probably enjoyed them with your little ones and/or put baby in front of one so you could take 20 minutes to shower and change the clothes you've been wearing for 2 and 1/2 days. But did you know that some Baby Einstein videos now include a "Grow with Your Baby" feature. The Grow with Me mode offers a second viewing option on the same DVD. It contains spoken words and additional content to entertain toddlers and prolong the life of the DVD.
After deployment the armies advanced. One single change I did for the solitaire rules was that instead of creating groups every turn with figures 10cm from each other, I’d simply activate groups of similar figures. The table being so small, I could probably get away with very little groups with the original mechanism, so I simply decided all similar troops were a group for the whole battle. So I dealt one card for trolls, one for dwarf archers, one for goblins with shield, one for the goblins with spears (reinforcements), etc.
Anyone who wishes to explore the possibility (from a non-biblical point of view) that there were two separate creation events on this earth, need only research the origins of domestic “farm” animals. You will quickly discover that these animals did not have their origins in Africa.

He hooked me up to the 3D sensors on my left side and had me ride again in the aerobars and in more of an upright position. The system takes the maximum and minimum measurements of your angles. For example, it measures the distance from the back of your calf to your hamstring at the top position while you are pedaling and also at the bottom. At that point, decisions can be made on how to achieve the best angles for comfort and to reduce pain, hot spots, and just plain bad mechanics.

Racists are a strange bunch. I am sure there are very well to do racists but these tend not to be the ones who are out and proud racists. The racist we see on TV are ignorant, incoherent, knuckle dragging thugs fixated on telling everyone that they are not actually racist and reminding everyone who will listen that they will not tolerate any racists within their organisation and then rolling out the token black racist to show us all that they can not be racist if they have a black racist in their organisation.

It's a tricky one though isn't it? Dress up, dress down, go in my pjs, glam it up and wear my wig (ugh), don't wear it and look like a demented poodle - will this encourage sympathy from the judge? And what is it with chemo hair eh? Why has it grown back curly and dark (not counting the grey bits boo hoo) - it's a very annoying length of about an inch and it looks like a fright wig. Well it frightens me when I look in the mirror, I don't look like my mother, I look like my grandmother. And I tell you something else, which is probably too much information, but what the hell I'm on a roll here, other hair, that was curly is now straight! I don't think it's changed places (oh please god no no no and everyone is being too polite and not telling me? aaaarrrgh) because the hair on my head is very soft and babylike, but as I said, poodle.

“And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. Therefore I say unto you, what things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.”
I'm not even sure I've had a washed rind sheeps' cheese before but like most sheeps cheeses it wasn't quite as rich as cows' cheeses - a benefit when you have the unctuous texture of a washed rind cheese to contend with. As you can see it was in perfect condition - wonderfully rich and savoury, but not over the top flavour-wise. So not particularly 'stinky'.

Then I started seeing a series of great Broadway musicals. I saw productions of THE KING & I and GUYS AND DOLLS. You know all the great musicals of that period, and I fell in love with show business. I became fascinated with show business. Meanwhile, at night, my parents were not allowing me to watch television, cause they considered it uncultured. So I was always listening to the radio. And to this day, I'm still mad with them, cause I really missed out on the golden age of comedy on television.

I have been couponing for about 6 months now. I used to laugh at those people on Extreme Couponing and how they'd act when shopping, but that was before I shopped with coupons. It really is a rush and I can see where it can get addicting. It's like a game to see how much you can save. I am definitely not an expert, but I do usually cut the grocery bill in half. One of my favorite couponing experiences is when I bought about $20 worth of stuff at CVS and only paid $0.24 for it!

This is the center part which is all rings. They instruct you to go back and forth with "turn" and they do say to when to use short picots and when to use long ones but give no measurement so I was guesstimating. As you can see in the next segment, I think I could tighten it up a bit, slightly smaller picots, and it will look better.
I often found myself in complete isolation, and with the irrational thought that I was the only one suffering from the condition. Once I realized that there were others (in numbers that I would have never conceived), I began to feel a glimmer of hope, that at the very least I was not alone. After I read all of the success stories of people who had overcome paruresis and now live happy and fulfilling lives, I realized at that moment that I was done moping. I was no longer going to sit by passively full of self-loathing and just take it. I had been dealt a crappy hand, but I was damn sure going to play it until I was raking in the chips.

I had high hopes for this bread. Very limited success with baking gluten-free, yeast-risen bread has made me a little resistant to subsequent attempts, perhaps made worse by my being so accustomed to and enamored of wheat bread (both in terms of the overall product and ease of making it). Unfortunately, this Millet Bread didn't do anything to soften my resistance. The dough was difficult to manage and the loaf ended up dense, with a tight crumb and coarse texture. O'Brien suggests broiling the loaf to brown the exterior; doing so ended up making a very hard crust, even without much browning. The flavor was fine, but not enough for me to want to make another attempt on this bread anytime soon.
I picked up some thin cork sheets from Michael's and cut them into strips. I glued the strips onto the edges of the tile using E-6000 glue (that stuff is amazing!).

What is time abundance? It is a mindset, like anything else. When we live with confidence and trust that we have more than enough time to fulfill our ultimate purpose, we are living in a time-abundant state. Consider the alternative: time starvation. Most of us live there most of the time.
And see we've been deceived.

Mike kept asking my what my favorite part was. Usually that's a pretty simple question for me to answer, but under these circumstances I just couldn't. Everything about it was amazing. From all of our cool conversations with fellow tourists and locals (I loved hearing many of their stories of how they decided to sell everything on the mainland and buy a one way ticket), to learning about the culture and plants, to hiking, rafting, snorkeling, and helicopter rides. Everyone there is in a good mood so it was so much fun to stir up a conversation with random people. It was definitely everything I ever imagined Hawaii to be, and more. Christian, one of our tour guides said it best. "We have no poison oak, no poison ivy, no snakes. It truly is paradise." Indeed it is.

A slight disappointment on Saturday (apart from Ballabriggs) was Samir Nasri who has hardly impressed me all season. On a scale of 0 to Cristina Pedroche (look her up), Nasri’s excitability rating scored relatively low when on the ball. His creative output can be summed up in three actions: hold the ball for two seconds, look around, then a simple 5-yard pass to feet. EVERY. TIME. I mean, that’s pretty much what I do. Not great.
Anyway, two golds went to UK brewers, the first was a category that I judged (along with several other UK judges including the lovely Glenn Payne and the fabulous Mr Dan Fox from the White Horse) and it was the subject of some really lively debate, which was brilliant because only good beer provokes passionate responses - the upshot of this being that Rooster's took a one and two in this category with Leghorn and YPA respectively, so well done Sean, I'm thrilled for you and feel you've taken two well-deserved wins there.
Kam Dhillon? This young lad from Southall, London, may not have been known by many a few months ago, but after his scorching debut release called ‘Dance With Me (Aaja Ni Aaja)’, he is now a household name! The Bhangra industry today is very difficult to please, but the critics have found it extremely difficult to pass on any sort of negative comments about this album. Links have been made to the huge success of Bally Jagpal and his debut release of ‘Live & Direct’, which proved that any producer needs to introduce themselves with a truly explosive release, and Kam has not dissapointed one little bit!
FDR had a lifelong affection for pets. His best-known was Fala, a Scottish terrier given to him by his cousin, Daisy Suckley, in 1940. Fala became Roosevelt’s constant companion and the most famous dog in America. He appeared in newspapers, cartoons, books, and films. Fala often accompanied FDR on trips. One trip to Alaska sparked a famous political debate during the 1944 presidential election campaign. Republicans falsely claimed that Fala had been mistakenly left behind on an Alaskan island and that FDR had ordered a destroyer to retrieve him. Roosevelt disarmed his critics in a celebrated speech. Fala’s frugal “Scotch soul was furious,” FDR reported, at allegations that taxpayer dollars were spent to rescue him.

For all of Moshe Rabbein’s frustration and mental anguish, caused by the truculent and abstinent Jewish nation, he desired only one thing from Hashem - to enter Eretz Yisrael. However, the gates of Eretz Yisrael and the opportunity to fulfill its respective mitzvot were hermetically closed before Moshe.

You can certainly forgive a friend or stranger who acted in the heat-of the moment. For the government to forgive a serial killer, a terrorist or a general dwyer, is to put thousands of innocent people at risk! We can then abolish the judiciary and just have a board that says “turn-the-other-cheek”!
The whole process is also resource-intensive, requiring large amounts of water and electricity.

Sometimes we can do no better than to turn to William Shakespeare when a doleful moment arises. He wrote quite a bit and profoundly too about vital issues and what we should do about them. Take for example his sonnet LXIV:
Whilst not truly onomatopoeic, the point is that I love the sound of win - dow - sill … it's the rising and falling cadence of the syllables that appeal and the added imagery of a sash window being raised and lowered on a Spring morning (or by an enraged news broadcaster) that makes windowsill infinitely more enjoyable than window ledge. (Try it win - dow - ledge … kinda plummets doesn’t it?)

The eulogies were beautifully written and vibrant in color. They were the stories of a girl who laughed often and loved deeply. The crowd heard of the child who shared her Oreos with a homeless guy. The story of winter boots left from “Mrs. Claus” was told by a teenage girl who remembered well the door-step package. Then there was the Kadie who wore pink bunny slippers to church every Sunday until Mrs. Mason stopped wearing her fur coat. They heard of the hospital volunteer who told a child his birthmark was an angel’s kiss. They were stories of a girl who dreamed she would change the world by sheer willpower alone. What she didn’t realize was that she had already changed the world because of her love. There were stories of pink tutus, sleepovers and summer swimming parties. Each story was another piece of Kadie; the only pieces left of Kadie. Mara sat there though, too numb to drink them in, too hurt to find a way to hang on to them. They washed over Mara one after another and like waves in the ocean, she knew each one was beautiful but it was impossible for her to capture them.
You know, usually I go for the bad guys, but Jack was just too sweet to resist! Reading about him just made me want to melt into a pile of warm mush. I cannot explain how much I am in love with him right now..! His love for Nikki is heartbreaking. He loves her so much that it hurts, it physically hurts, and for her to be gone months, for him to lose her, I can't even imagine... My heart shatters for him. I wanted to reach in and take away his pain, hug him and hold him♥

OK, so, the bible is dropped off and some students took one. Well, they have to be ready to also pass out other "holy" books and teachings on religion. Segregating children to one religion is ignorant in a public education system. If the children learn one religion at home, that is different. But, educators, that is their job, to educate. And the word educate is an extremely broad term.
Both Gleeson and Farrell benefits from the originality of MacDonagh’s script. The dialogue has a matter of fact manner that allows the audience to explore the characters as the film develops. It can be compared to an eccentric Samuel Becketts “Waiting for Godot” or Pulp Fictions “Royale with Cheese” exchange. Despite the obvious contract killing, cocaine/heroine abuse/dealing and prostitution, McDonagh is still able to delve into some serious themes throughout the film.

It’s assumed as the economy grows; it will produce more of what people want. Government policies can be put in place to encourage or discourage economic growth. Governments pass laws designed to encourage growth in specific industry sectors in many ways. Research and development are often subsidized through tax credits or exemptions. Infrastructure expenditures are also seen as promoting economic growth. On the other hand, some argue that tax laws which deter wealthy individuals and businesses from domestic business investment or incentivize investing their resources in other countries will cause growth in the U.S. to decline.

When he first came down later this morning, after I was through taking the pictures – he asked “can I sit down now?” and then “are you putting it all back, this looks so stupid.” How nice! After I explained that no, I wasn’t putting it back the way it was, I showed him his new basket for all his junk, I mean, coin catalogues. He buys gold coins just like Glenn Beck. And then he plopped down, despite it looking so stupid, and made himself at home. Him and those slippers socks. Oy. And extra points if you can find Georgie – in her camo colored coat.

Those of you on my Facebook page, where I shared a sneak peak that I was cleaning my water kettle for a post, did you ever think it would be about this?!
Daniel was not liked by those who wanted his place. People around him were envious of him and his position with the king, so they moved in to get rid of him. They were caught up in the things of the world. They wanted the prestige and the power that came with the right hand man position of the king. They were willing to do anything to get that position. They did not know God. But sometimes in our day there are people who know God but are so hung up in getting their worldly due they will twist what God has said to ift them and tar others down.

Add pea tendrils and broth, salt & pepper. When pea tendrils have wilted, add white wine. Cook for a couple more minutes, adding more broth or pasta cooking water if necessary so the sauce isn't dry. Toss with cooked pasta.

Even though my cousins and I are all grown up, we still love Easter egg hunting. When I spent Easter with my cousins in America last year, they felt that being past the age of five meant that they were too old to look for Easter eggs. My cousins here in the Philippines are different. We’d hunt every inch of our Batangas property just so we could get as many Easter eggs as possible.

The food was so good. I’m not entirely sure what kind of spices they used in everything, but it hit the spot.

I didn’t know what it was until after I was almost done, but wasn’t expecting that. Still, very good.

Basically, Obama has refused to have the Greater Israel Lobby move the red lines to rendering Iran incapable of producing a nuclear weapon, rather than deciding to make one or actually making one. And this will be where the Greater Israel lobby shifts its support to the Christianist GOP, already committed to the Netanyahu-Lieberman position on Iran and the settlements, and now financed by Greater Israel fanatics, like Sheldon Adelson. (Here's a response to the Atlantic interview in an Adelson newspaper in Israel.) So no surprise to hear Liz Cheney was on a panel with this kind of reception:

Sometimes trust takes time to build and develop, while other times, trust is given merely because of one's position. In such a case, it is assumed that the position automatically comes with the requisite knowledge and experience, even though that might not be the actuality. The assumption creates a responsibility for that person to live up to the perceived trust. In time, that assumed trust can be shattered if the person bearing the position proves unworthy, destroying any chance of a further relationship.

She calls herself a “blessed girl” and she is currently working hard to finish her Senior year of high school. Her family continues to live in poverty, but Thembi possesses a calm joyfulness that comes in knowing that God has plans for her and more than that, He is with her each step of the journey.
School is almost over! Only one more week and then finals. It’s so crazy how quick it went, and how much work gets assigned at the end! I swear I’ve had a total of 10 papers due in since my last post. And a few exams. Some of them have been KILLER. I studied my ass off for my CHD development exam and I’m pretty damn sure I aced it. My math class is the one that has been giving me the most stress, but I’m really keeping the positive outlook on it and keeping my spirits up.

I think they voted for me because I was a model student, haha.
The second woman in Alex's life is Ivona, a plain Polish woman whom he met when she simply made up the numbers on an evening out with friends at college. With a 'docile and long-suffering manner' she gives 'the impression of a natural born victim' something that makes Alex feel both sorry for her and hugely irritated by her. But she seems devoted to him, something very different to 'the usual back-and-forth, the game of trying to seduce a woman.'

So as I noted above, there are nine 24-hour Walmarts along a 150-mile stretch of highway leading to my town. It could take anywhere from 8 to 12 hours to go to the other end of the route and then go to each store one by one, picking up all of the items I’m trying to stock up on, and finally unloading at my house at the end of the trip. But since we’ve already seen that just because there’s a 24-hour Walmart that there’s no guarantee something will be on the shelf, what kind of fool would I be just to give up and go home? I’d be a hungry fool! But let’s do the math on best-case scenarios on what I COULD get, if everything (including Great Value canned carrots!) is on the shelf. Let’s say that at each of the nine Walmarts, I’m able to get at least a case of carrots or other canned vegetables, a case of canned fruit, a case of canned salmon, 10 lbs. of dry beans and five 42-ounce containers of oatmeal (an average shopping trip for me, not counting refrigerated or frozen items). If I’m able to pick up at least this much of these items at each of the nine 24-hour Walmarts on my route, I’ll arrive home with 108 cans of vegetables, 108 cans of fruit, 108 cans of salmon, 90 lbs. of dry beans and almost 119 lbs. of oatmeal. That’s a pretty good start, and not bad for a day’s work! How long will it take to get a single sandwich or bowl of soup — if anything — if I have to wait in lines at soup kitchens or FEMA centers if I’m foolish enough to keep waiting instead of stocking up now?

If someone is not a Christian, and is involved in homosexual activity, chances are that no amount of preaching is going to change their mind. Their position is fostered by the sinful nature which dwells within, and from which, without Christ, they have no escape. To them, homosexuality is just a lifestyle, whether they believe it is the way they were born, or it is a choice. Society has accepted this stance as well and just serves to nurture their belief that there is nothing wrong with what they are doing. For this reason, the primary goal should be to reach these people with the gospel of Christ. Until and unless they receive the Lord, they will have no reason to seek to change. So proclaiming the gospel to these people is the most loving thing we can do for them.

The trouble with Madalyn was that she needlessly alienated a whole lot of people, many of them atheists. She saw herself as the epitome of what a self-respecting atheist was supposed to be, and if you had a less confrontative vision, she considered you a coward. Because of her harshness, one of her followers founded The Freedom from Religion Foundation, which is now much larger than American Atheists. Another problem with Madalyn was that when she died, her organization nearly folded. That’s just how it is with personality-dominated groups.

A lot of men will seek out transsexuals for dating and love because they feel that transsexuals are actually more feminine than genetic women. Yes, that is right….MORE feminine! Additionally, men find that genetic women have a lot of hangups in the bedroom department that they feel transsexuals do not have. While that may be true to some extent, it’s not a hard and fast rule to live by. Transsexuals who were born in a male body, but have female brain chemistry and are truly women stuck in a man’s body until they begin transitioning into a female outer appearance. However, it must be known that nobody should be judged solely on their outward appearance as their are many complicated circumstances that hinder the transitioning process, most of which come from society and financial barriers.
Each human person is made up of two essential parts, body and soul. The body we can see; the soul we can’t see. The body is material; the soul is spiritual. God dwells in the soul through grace. We call this the “Indwelling Presence,” or the “Divine Indwelling.” From time to time, each person becomes aware of the soul through an interior nudging of the Holy Spirit.

I am so glad I hung out in punk clubs while I was cutting school and being “very disappointing” because I had “so much potential” It makes me laugh now. Most of the time sitting in school was listening to teachers go on about themselves. I had a teacher that liked to talk about how much he related with “Porkys” the movie, why? Or the female teacher who would do exercises in low-cut dresses in front of junior high boys? WTF? Is wrong with people?
Well-timed one-liners throughout keep the movie flowing. I never expected the Hulk to have such a presence. Sure, he’ll smash any and everything in sight but Mark Ruffalo made Bruce Banner/Hulk his character. I actually liked this version better than the one Edward Norton or Eric Bana played. Whether it was Dr. Banner revealing that he was able to control his rage or Hulk nonchalantly punching Thor or waking Iron Man out of a near coma, the added personality to the character is a win for fans and the franchise.

And then in route to Ireland they got sidetracked in Italy where they encountered a crazy monkey named Uga Borba who liked to bite of people’s toes. And he has this whole backstory about his dad named Gordon (when I got to this part of the story, I had to stop for like a full 20 seconds to try and think of a name for the dad, under the pretense that I was trying to “remember” it. And the best I could come up with was Gordon…) Basically Gordon had a habit of biting of people’s thumbs, but one day decided not to. And oh my goodness I am getting tired of telling this story. Just as I was getting tired of telling Miranda the pink joke back when I initially conceived the story. And no, she never figured out there was no punchline. After like two hours of me talking, I eventually just gave in and told her the catch.
Each day, as I enter or exit my workplace, I pass by a very popular jar that has been strategically placed on a counter near our reception area. I say, “strategically placed” because it is incredibly inviting to anyone passing by either entering or exiting the work area. You know the old saying, “they get you coming AND going!” In this situation, I find that statement applies directly.

One of the most notable and perhaps profound of those influences was Arthur Schopenhauer whom Nietzsche discovered in 1865 while at University. Schopenhauer’s metaphysical vision at odds with Christianity, encapsulated in The World as Will and Representation, was to shape Nietzsche’s philosophical undertakings more than any other. A year later Nietzsche was introduced to Wagner, with whom he felt a deep affiliation through mutual love of both music and philosophy. Wicks notes: “Partly on the basis of their shared enthusiasm for Schopenhauer, the two men struck up a father-son style of friendship and they remained in contact for the next decade, until Nietzsche’s growing anti-Christian view of life became incompatible with Wagner’s.” Later, Nietzsche irreparably widened the division by openly and virulently criticising his one-time idol in The Case of Wagner. In the essay Nietzsche lambasts the Wagnerian tradition with unrelenting ardour, finding it to be “brutal, artificial and unsophisticated” and thereby symptomatic of the degenerative trend in music. He is no less vituperative when speaking of the composer himself, querying: “Is Wagner a man at all? Is he not rather a disease? Everything he touches he contaminates. He has made music sick,” before concluding: “Wagner’s art is diseased. The problems he sets on the stage are all concerned with hysteria; the convulsiveness of his emotions, his over-excited sensitiveness, his taste which demands ever sharper condimentation, his erraticness which he togged out to look like principles, and, last but not least, his choice of heroes and heroines, considered as physiological types (—a hospital ward!—).”

It was HIS experience with a highly repressive regime that had slowly built his inner-desperation; Police had confiscated his produce cart because he lacked a permit and beat him up when he resisted. Local officials then refused to hear his complaint. His act of desperation highlighted the public’s boiling frustration over police violence, living standards, rampant unemployment and lack of basic human rights. The protests begun that same day and then quickly spread across the entire region.

The year after she died, the church recognized Jill's absence with a 4 minute silence during the Christmas Eve service, while the organist played the accompaniment without her. It was a sad but beautiful moment, as we all imagined Jill singing down from Heaven in a voice that only angels could hear.

8 Facts About ME:
Scapegoating and religion have kept close company, according to Mr. Campbell, a former editor at the Literary Review. Christianity’s central figure can be viewed as a scapegoat, taking on humanity’s sin and in the process earning a trip to Golgotha. Early believers were blamed for various disasters and accused of hideous behavior, including incest, cannibalism and child murder—accusations, Mr. Campbell adds, that Christians would later level against their own adversaries. “Ultimately our imagination is relatively limited when it comes to wickedness,” Mr. Campbell writes, “and the authorities trot out the same list of accusations towards minorities they wish to demonize.”

Right now, I’m taking a focus on increasing my leafy greens in my diet. I’m adding more salads, more green snacks and my animals stare at me with envy when I’m eating dinner. I’m trying to up my top of the food density choices. Once you figure out broadly how to live, you tweak and make adjustments until you have honed in on your ideal way of eating.

Mockingjay clarifies the ending events of Catching Fire for us: namely, there was a vast allyship hidden from Peeta and Katniss, the goal of which was to yank a core group of Victors free from the Quell and begin the all-out rebellion against the Capitol. Peeta is left behind, and has become the puppet of President Snow, urging for a ceasefire in official televised interviews, earning him the label of traitor.
4. The Vatican, for its part, seems to have nothing encouraging to say about independent bishops. One of the more common claims of Vatican recognition for the sacraments and orders of the Liberal Catholic Church, for instance – a supposed positive ruling by the Roman Congregation of Rites – has been exposed as a hoax. (See: “Rome and Liberal Catholic Orders,” by Rev. L. K. Langley at: www.lcc.cc/tlc/lxvi1/rome.htm) The Vatican’s stance appears to be that so-called valid orders are worthless without the Church’s recognition.
This really is an eclectic grouping. I'm sure some of you that are a few years older would have 1975 in your top 10 or higher, but it was in that "too new to be vintage, too old to be current" stage when I first started collecting.

“To my mind, existential boredom is a hotchpotch of a category, and one whose basis is more intellectual than experiential—it is a condition which seems to me to be more read about and discussed than actually experienced.

Far from being a document cobbled together by a motley crew of so called “constitutional experts”, the document Kenyans are voting on is a result of decades of peaceful and persistent agitation, propaganda, mobilization by a relay of generations of democratic patriots past and present. Perhaps one of the most poignant reminders of these years of self-less sacrifice was illustrated recently when about forty former detainees, political prisoners, victims of repression and survivors of torture converged at the residence of one of their own colleagues- Raila Odinga, the Prime Minister.
England’s World Cup campaign kicked off last night with an unconvincing 1-1 draw with the USA.

The reader turns the page and WHUMP – Cap makes good on his threat.

We’re willing to forgive the whole murder thing in sheer relief at sidestepping tedium.)

In the ensuing days, Mr. Shiftlet made great progress fixing things all around the house and farm, even getting the old car working and teaching the daughter Lucynell how to say “bird.” Seeing the advantages to having a hardworking man around to run things, the mother begins to suggest Mr. Shiftlet marry her daughter. She had worked a cold business calculus in her mind and figured the shiftless, one armed drifter could be an asset. She makes known how good an idea it would be as long as he planned on staying. He could be married, have this house, a place to sleep and good food for life. He at first put off the idea, knowing full well he had the free spirit of a drifter. Eventually, he negotiated against his nature. He’d think of marrying her if he had some money to buy some gas, take her someplace, buy her a meal on their honeymoon. Settling for $17.50 was as close to romance the drifter and the deaf-mute would come.

Anyway, by this point I was on the verge of breaking- I felt so convicted of the decision that needed to be made but kept fighting it, not willing to fully submit and let God completely take over. Once I finally gave up, threw my hands in the air and prayed unwaveringly for a way out, God swooped me up so fast it’s no wonder I feel like that was a lifetime ago……
In the new world, the hero begins to meet various characters. Some are enemies. Some are allies. Some are both. One fun archetype in this type of story is the apparent enemy who later becomes a friend. True Grit and Rango are both chock full of interesting and unpredictable characters. In my book, P.K. makes valuable allies in the form of several newspapermen, a Soiled Dove named Belle and a Chinese boy called Ping. And of course there is Poker Face Jace, who knows how to read body language.

It’s always a joy for me to attend church with my Mom on Sunday ~ the church in which I grew up in … where I found Jesus, met my husband, got married, dedicated my babies, my Daddy’s funeral, … During the Sunday School hour, I chose to sit in the Senior Adult class with those I have known for many years, discussing the disciple Peter and his tragic failure of loyalty … a lesson from the Nazarene spring quarterly. I chimed in with my own comment that even though Peter failed and made a horrible mess of things, because of Christ’s love and forgiveness, Peter was restored and later had a dynamic ministry in spite of his past. I’m personally grateful that Jesus does not just condemn and leave me in a pile to rot. But instead, he is all about redemption and restoration.

The tall Icelandic man that plays under the alias Bang Gang is just as diverse as the northern country itself. Bardi Johannsson’s cohesion between his soft acoustic melodies and his daring electronica explorations directly reflect the contrasting landscapes of his native land; where lustrous geysers and incautious volcanoes live enharmonic with one another. Bang Gang’s 2000 début, "You", was met with great fanfare and critical revelry, while the follow-up, 2003’s "Something Wrong", cemented his artistic and commercial success. Bang Gang’s third full-length, "Ghosts from the Past", is currently being released in various markets worldwide and is, according to early reviews, already a strong contender for album of the year.
Between idea conception and present day, the Paint by Number art phenomenon has come full circle. In the 1960s it was adopted into the realm of Pop Art. Then, in the 1970s the designs became more abstract to fit the maturing tastes of art enthusiasts. By the 1990s, Paint by Number was looking for ways to regain a footing in the craft market of America; a telephone survey led them to create the “America’s Most Wanted” kit. Around this time, numerous children’s art companies, like Crafthouse and Janlynn started to produce Paint by Number kits for kids; there are even designs inspired by Disney Characters.

201. A cheery finish to a week that started out a bit rough.
As we left yesterday afternoon, we knew he wouldn't last more than a couple of days. I whispered in his ear, "Dad, we love you. We'll miss you, but we'll be fine. If you're ready to go, you go. Be at peace." Sounds just like the lovely little speeches you hear in the movies, doesn't it? But it was probably more for me than him, since the earbuds were still in place. Anyway, he was ready. A hospice volunteer was sitting with him during the night; nobody thought there was any need to summon Kay from the apartment downstairs. At a few minutes before 2 a.m., Dad's roommate woke up and sauntered over to say a few words. A nurse checked in. Moments later, the volunteer saw that Dad had stopped breathing. (We know this because that wonderful volunteer actually came back this afternoon to tell our family about those last moments, to reassure Kay that her husband had slept away and had not been alone. Thank you, hospice volunteers.)

Just before Mr. Panetta arrived at Camp Bastion, an Afghan interpreter stole a truck from a British soldier — who was injured, and may have been run over during the incident — and then crashed the perimeter fence of the airbase. The driver then apparently doused himself with gasoline and set himself on fire.

So why was Fregosi well-known as a shortstop prior to coming to New York? As my husband Ed said, Fregosi makes his list “For not being able to say to the Mets, ‘Dude, I’m a shortstop, not a third baseman’ before they traded Nolan Ryan for him.” Plus it’s funny because Fregosi was also traded to the Texas Rangers and Mets favorite Wayne Garrett played third base in 1973. This was the Mike Bordick deal before Bordick was born, basically.

Only once the accident had happened do we realise what happened and what the dangers and consequences of the accident are. Only once the dust had settled do we realise how many people were in the car, that there is a baby in the back-seat, the fuel tank is leaking and the car may burst into flames. Only then can we assess the damage. Only then do we realise some are seriously injured and some are fine.

When we think of customer loyalty, we often think about ways to intrigue prospects and engage customers, building a relationship over time. So you might be surprised to find out the extent to which the first impression actually fuels customer loyalty. First impressions aren’t just critical to customer loyalty, they’re essential. In First Impressions Critical for Fueling Customer Loyalty on marketing charts.com, an April 2012 survey by ClickFox reveals that “customer loyalty is most often formed as a result of first impressions…”
Obviously there are many different types of lawyers practicing many different facets of the civil and criminal law. However, it seems to me that they fall broadly into two main groups – those that ensure we act in ways according to the law and those that bring their skills to bear when the law is broken. The former can concern themselves with say, drawing up contracts or examining agreements to identify if a particular course of action by one party can proceed. The latter litigate. (I have excluded the rather nebulous and elastic concept of international law governing how states relate to each other.)
"Hello dear, it's been such a long day"
So my first item sold for about 70% of what I retail it for. Not great but not bad. I had to wait til that one sold til I could schedule another one. When you are new and until you build your reputation, you can only list one lot at a time. Seems fair, as they don't want scam sellers there but believe me, it is an eternity waiting for your item to come up and to be able to get a slot for the next one! LOL!
See how there are light wave shapes alternated with dark wave shapes? I've decided to connect with my inner Angela Walters (yeah, right!!) and quilt the light ones with a feathery type motif and the dark ones with a flowery design. I quilted my first light one, and then unpicked most of it (I forgot to take photos) because I didn't think ahead at all, and it looked awful. The next go was slightly better - not perfect, but I'm pretty happy with it considering I've never done feathers before. It's a bit hard to see the stitching cos I'm using Aurifil 50wt cream thread and it's disappearing into the quilt beautifully. I'm hoping it will mostly be the texture rather than visible quilting.
So I’m going to speak today about passions. Why passions? It’s pretty simple, really – for me, unschooling is a bit like a tree. It starts with a seed of consciously choosing a better life for you and your family, and grows into something absolutely beautiful and unique, sometimes unwieldy, rarely predictable. And like all trees, it needs roots. I think that passions are the very root of unschooling. You know, there are many “definitions” for unschooling, but personally I think definitions are a bit limiting and rule-bound. So I try to think of unschooling in terms of principles. The simplest, most concise statement of unschooling principles is one I am lifting straight from Joyce Fetterroll: humans are born learners. Children will learn best when given the freedom to learn what, when and how they want.

Here on the island we also rely on home delivery, by either Schwans (love it!) or amazon grocery, etc. You can find great deals if you are willing and able to buy in bulk, and buying in bulk is a really good idea when you’re on an island. It is a practice that I will continue when and if we ever move mainland. Coupons are also a huge help, which most of you already know. The coupon craze is more than just a fad and I don’t know any budget-conscience mom who doesn’t clip and save. To be sure I have no advice to share that hasn’t already been shared. But in case you are not a Harris Teeter shopper, if you live near one this is the best place to redeem your coupons. They double coupons everyday (up to 99 cent) and on a quarterly basis (sometimes more often) they have triple coupon days. They also do super double days which double coupons up to $1.99. The closest Harris Teeter to me is about 85 or 90 miles, but it is worth it to make the trip if I have enough coupons and a long enough list.
16:05: Patrick Basham fields a question from Chris Snowdon by opining that the welfare state is used by government as a club to beat smokers with. That we must dictate what others do because all of society pay for it. He says this is a false premise as it's clear that smokers cost society less money, not more.
In the text of the act, the law is allowed to be used against anyone who knowingly enters or remains in a restricted building or grounds without lawful authority to do so, but those grounds are considered any area where someone — rather it’s President Obama, Senator Santorum or Governor Romney — will be temporarily visiting, whether or not the public is even made aware. Entering such a facility is thus outlawed, as is disrupting the orderly conduct of “official functions,” engaging in disorderly conduct “within such proximity to” the event or acting violent to anyone, anywhere near the premises. Under that verbiage, that means a peaceful protest outside a candidate’s concession speech would be a federal offense, but those occurrences covered as special event of national significance don’t just stop there, either. And neither does the list of covered persons that receive protection.

Many people say that celebrities are not normal anymore when they become famous. Well, needless to say, that’s not true at all. Sure, some celebrities let the whole famous thing get to their heads, but most celebrities that I’m a huge fan of, don’t let being famous take over their lives.

(if you think my referring to the US/UK Military-Industrial-Parliamentary/Congressional Complex as fascists, think about the definition of fascism said to have been made by Mussolini: ‘Fascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power,’ and check back for a following post which will provide more information and research sources on the issue.)

Yesterday, I wrote a lovely piece about the dangers of following parenting "doctrines" too closely. In that post, I mentioned that there really are a lot of different ways to parent, based on the variety of circumstances and beliefs inherent in any particular family. While I have my own opinions about cloth diapers, breast feeding, co-sleeping, and TV restrictions, I also recognize that there are millions of brilliant parents with healthy, happy kids who do not share my views. That alone indicates that there is more than one way to skin a cat, as it were.

8. Qwiki: It’s not perfect but any website that allows you to search for a topic then watch a slideshow about that topic while listening to audio content (a little fast but still useful) has to be a winner. Yes, the automated voice is a little annoying (but you can control the volume and pause the slideshow/go back over things) and the images are sometimes not the most accurate (check something before you let the children loose) but the pros still outweigh the cons as far as I am concerned. It even has read along captions with the slideshow which you can turn off if you want to.
As all good inspectors do, he sought out his crime maps for the intelligence analyst and looked at his monthly, six-monthly and annual crime, broken down by crime type: robbery, burglary, vehicle crime, violent crime, anti-social behaviour, etc., etc..

Very, very high levels of reported violent crime.

That is especially true if you’re not skilled or experienced, although unskilled and inexperienced writers sometimes let ego get in the way of learning the lessons an editor can teach.

A good editor will make your writing better.

But extreme hats? I think we can all appreciate the artistry, but honestly… Beatrice and Eugenie were a subject of conversation, but who wants to be spoken about like that?! Also, can we for a minute discuss the fascinator? This may be the best named accessory on earth for the sheer fact that it is so fascinating, and by that I mean it sort of makes women look like those primordial deep water fish that have light bulbs and other fishing rod type ‘bait’ hanging off their heads. Do men understand what we’re trying to achieve with these things? Do we?
Similar to the above, second on the essentials list are trainers. Let’s get real here, the trainers you wore before and during pregnancy may no longer be suitable. It’s not uncommon for pregnant women’s feet to swell up to one shoe size, so, if when you put your dusty old trainers on for the first time since giving birth, that they feel too tight, chances are, they need replacing. A lot of new mums come to me saying they suffer with knee pain. The first thing I do is take a look at their trainers, and 9 times out of 10, they’ve had it. So, if you’re serious about getting back into shape, you’ve got to look after your very foundation, which are your feet. Trainers should feel comfortable, and give you adequate support too (just like your sports bra), so don’t just buy trainers because they “look good”, they’ve got to “feel good” too. Trainers come in all shapes and sizes and styles, but you’ve got to know the difference between a cross trainer and a running shoe, for example, so ask in store what sorts of activities each shoe is designed for, when you try them on.

Jon Huntsman: “Given the bandwidth that has been taken out of the discussion of any other issues pertinent to this campaign, a reconsideration might be in order. … Every time another accusation comes up, it diminishes our ability to stay focused on the issues that really do matter for the American people, and I think that’s a disservice to the voters.”

Then, campaigns. During the 2004 presidential election, I worked for John Kerry. At every rally, and I mean EVERY rally, the song “No Surrender” played as soon as the candidate finished speaking. My dear friend Crystal will attest to this day it is impossible to hear the drum riff at the beginning of the song without thinking that it is time to move the press to the bus. Pavlov aside, that song was our anthem. At the end of the campaign, it had become a war cry.
Saturday, April 13, 2012, could pass for a very bad day for Mr. Nwakama, his wife and others on a South East-bound bus. That day, dare devil armed robbers, attacked them, near Okada town, in Edo State. Nwakama (other names withheld), a Lagos-based businessman, was one of the victims of the robbery attack. Narrating his bad experience, he revealed that he and his wife had boarded at Berger, at the boundary between Lagos and Ogun states, on their way to attend the burial of his wife’s uncle in Delta State. He said he intended to travel in the night but his wife suggested they should rather take a day bus for security reason.

"Sirens of Titan" was first published in 1959 and since then has been nominated for a Hugo Award and hailed as a beloved classic. "Sirens of Titan" cuts with satirical wit at humanity's follies, the belief of a divine hand guiding the individual, while at the same time cherish free will. Throughout the whole novel, Vonnegut takes a stab at omniscience and religion, the purpose of humanity and the deconstruction of the family unit.

It is true though one must be careful in this genre. You should have a story and a message. Few people want to read a fictionalized account of how wise your grandparents were. To be incredibly crass but completely realistic, tragedy sells, but it has to be written in a way which interests many people, and something the public at large can relate to. And again it is worth repeating, once you decide to go down this path, you must be willing to lay your soul bare and express its pain as well as the joy. If you cannot do this, memoir writing is just not for you.
Everyone considers the ancient sage and teacher Confucius to be the great master, even Lao Tzu bows down to him, but even Confucius acknowledges that he himself was taught by a master.
But there is a much more dangerous form of objectification going on, than just thinking of another person as a vessel for one’s own personal pleasure. Admittedly, it’s sexual in nature. But not inherently pleasurable. It’s the form of objectification that regards women as little more than incubators for children.

So, where DO kids in a small conservative (I used to live nearby so I feel pretty comfortable saying this) community in Northwest Iowa learn it’s okay, maybe even necessary, to punish someone for being gay? Who might be influencing them and the adults in their lives who teach them this is somehow okay? Who is or recently has been all over radio, TV, the Internet, telling them some combination of: gays are bad, a threat, undeserving of equal rights, going to hell, and/or destroying America?

I bought four of the size small covers, and I think they'd work better for pudgy apple-shaped babies, since the velcro closures practically overlapped on my long and lean little guy -- even though at 12 lbs. he was right in the "up to 14 lb" range for the size small. You'd certainly need a separate newborn cover if you wanted to cloth diaper a small baby. Overall they're decent covers, but I definitely didn't reach for them first and may only use them as back-up covers with future babies.

I am a big fan of baby-wearing and do it as often as possible, even around the house! I love it and so does the Velociraptor. I love being close to her just as much as she does to me.

Baby-wearing helps me get stuff done around the house and keeps my baby happy so in my opinion two rights can not make a wrong =)

I can understand how Valentine’s Day can suck if you’re single. Going out and seeing a bunch of couple madly in love or madly in lust or just out so they can have Valentine’s sex. I know how that is. It’s annoying. It reminds you of how you hate being single. I get where that bitterness derives from. Even still, that’s not an excuse to sit around and talk shit about everyone else that is in a relationship or has a Valentine.

But there is something that worries me. I've mentioned before that if every licensee stuck a couple of casks on, that then didn't sell, you'd end up with a situation where cask beer is available everywhere, but quality hugely hit-and-miss.

We just discussed how a logo should be designed in order to be enlarged properly. What about being shrunk? Don’t think your logo will ever need to be shrunk? What about profile pictures on social networking sites? What about when you sponsor an event and they want to put a tiny version of your logo on their flyer? If your logo is not very simple, there will be entirely too much going on for it to make sense in a smaller size. Take a picture of 3 pencils on a table with erasers in between them. Shrink the picture to a tiny size. Can you make out what the erasers are? You probably cannot.

I also think they would look amazing with this season's mid-length skirt, too.

Basically, we don't know what is going to happen, and probably an expert with sufficient information to make a more likely scenario (than others) isn't motivated to disclose his thoughts, as there is no gain in taking a position that is moderate.

In other words, by thinking of possible catastrophes, and recommending appropriate actions to reduce the likelihood or the consequences of such possibilities.

Some Of The Main Reasons Your Really Need To Wear A Bike Helmet When Bicycling
SETTLING vs ACCEPTANCE Settling is giving up things you really want just to have something. Accepting is taking something for what it is and being satisfied with that. For example, a friend of mine is in a relationship with a guy she met when we were in college. He’s not her type physically, many of the things that are consistent about him annoy her, and she’s always always ALWAYS arguing with him. Despite the fact that I’m convinced she enjoys the dysfunction, she is settling for him & she knows it. She simply does not want to be alone, so she has chosen to be miserable. Had she accepted him as he is, the things that have proven to be consistent about him would not bother her as much as they do. And they would argue less, because she would accept that the things they argue about are things that will not change. He is who he is. Whether or not he chooses to change in order to please her is his decision. I wouldn’t hold my breath if I was her.

No matter the thoughts of those who do not live here, it is believed that Heaven is visible from Loathsome Creek. Compared to most of the country, the skies are crisp and clear, lacking vast amounts of pollution. The best mind altering drug is inhaling the magical country air, which envelopes the mountains in a constant breeze. It is never stale or stagnant. During Spring, the brilliant skies are abundant with seasonal birds, which is a marvelous sight to see. However, the bird calls can be deafening. Blue Jays, Cardinals, Ravens, Eagles, Chicken Hawks, Sparrows and Humming birds are all masters of the skies on Loathsome Creek.
The other advantage to whipping up your own hummus is the price. A small tub of store-bought hummus easily goes for $5. Your own? Much less. The priciest item is the jar of tahini, which lasts for many batches. The other items—lemon, canned or dried garbanzo beans, hot sauce, garlic—are quite economical. Homemade hummus can be tweaked to your preferences. Like it chunky? Go easy on the food processor. Silky smooth? Add more liquid and blend away. Spicy? More Tabasco. Enough garlic to ward off the Twilight trilogy? Add a few cloves. You get the idea.

I started this blog talking a lot about comparative religion and my experiences in Arkansas as a new minority. For the last semester I've been out of the state, and really out of touch with the world lol.
Blockbuster cooperated much better this time, so the movie version of Cujo will be here on Thursday and I’ll probably get around to watching it this weekend. So I should be back sometime early next week with my thoughts on that.

First up is HAED's Princess Izzy. Here's the before shot from last months update.....
If you are in the mood for a creepy read, this one's for you! I admit that I am not a big fan of paranormal and I am very picky when it comes to the books I choose. However, when David Morgan contacted me about a possible review for his book, The Boo Hag, I read the synopsis and immediately knew I wanted to read it. Actually, I knew I wanted to read it as soon as I saw the cover. Those big, creepy red eyes over the sleeping girl raised the hair on my arms. I am so happy to say that The Boo Hag did not disappoint!
We continue to see individuals fearful of owning equities due to an aversion to potential losses. This negativity is a real positive for owners of companies (that’s you if you hold stocks) over the long haul. The average individual investor is terrified of the market.
14. It’s ok to be afraid, but it’s not ok to let fear stop you from doing what you love
“Then we won’t touch.” I pulled my hand back and smiled when she stood. “Just dance.”
The Edge weekly reported over a week ago that Khazanah might sell its stake in Proton to DRB-Hicom, which also assembles cars for Suzuki, Mercedes-Benz and global car maker Volkswagen AG (VW).

He was a true statesman; “In necessary things, unity; in doubtful things, liberty; in all things, charity,” he was fond of saying. Baxter, for his part, did his best to avoid the disputes between Anglicans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and other denominations, even convincing local ministers to cooperate in some pastoral matters. The interest in cooperation was not due to a lack of conviction. Among his more than 200 works are long, controversial discourses on doctrine. Still, he believed society was a large family under a loving father, and in his theology, he tried to cut between the extremes.

Today's contestant of the new generation of garage rockers comes from our nations capital, Washington DC, and goes by the moniker, The Hall Monitors. You really have no reason to miss these guys since they play Thursday, March 19 7:00 p.m. @ Wave Rooftop (408 E 6th St). Do you really have a better band to see at 7PM? I can answer that, "no". You probably don't have a better 8, 9, or 10PM band to see than the Hall Monitors.
But I'm not writing them anymore. Max and Jules have their own life now, and as more and more people read their story once it comes out next week, I'll relinquish more and more ownership of those characters. Sure, they belong to me in a legal sense. But in the way that matters, they belong to you, to everyone who goes with them on their journey towards their happily ever after. They belong to the reader.
^^ It’s true. You make mistakes, people you love will make mistakes… people will hurt you, I promise you. But it’s life. Dust yourself off, take the message out of the situation and lay the remainder to rest! Don’t beat yourself up or anyone else up over something that’s happened, it doesn’t change anything and as this picture states out, you end up completely overlooking what you were initially supposed to learn from it!
Don’t leave the door open too long when taking food out. The longer the door is open, the more cold air escapes, and the more energy is needed to restore the temperature again.
“Set in a fictional universe in which alchemy is one of the most advanced scientific techniques known to man, the story follows the brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric, who want to restore their bodies after a disastrous failed attempt to bring their mother back to life through alchemy. They are striving to find the legendary Philosopher’s Stone so that they may recover parts of their bodies that they lost in an attempt to bring their mother back to life. Therefore, Edward joins the state military and discovers that several members of the military are also attempting to get the stone and using it to destroy humanity and control the world. Many dark secrets are revealed which are of a matter to concern to both brothers and the nation.” – Baka Updates
So whilst I would like to have it done yesterday it might actually be a few more weeks.
Oddly author Colm Ó Toibín echoed this in a statement on the programme. That Irish Catholics take the “religious aspect” of the Church but have rejected the “church authority”.
Another thing that's changed is that as we've stepped out of the shadow, the broom closet, and the history books, we've drawn a lot more attention to ourselves. Where once cries of occult ritual murders and such would have meant a lot of hysteria, but now they are real attacks against our ways of life. In California, there is still a battle over freedom of religion, where paganism is not counted in the "Big Five" (three of which are Christianity, Judaism, and Islam) and thus "may not have the same rights and protections" as the "big five."
The best part of The Aubrey though was their afternoon tea service. Well it's no joke I'm a sucker for tea and cookies, so each day I worked my plan around this respite -- using the time to journal alongside a different sweet and tea leaf. The best tea hour was when there was just a caramel and coconut shortbread tart sitting there near the golden tea cups (ooh la la!!) looking so unassuming. Naturally I had to try a bite and bam 2 slices later, I declared it my early dinner and I was jammin from the sugar high.
I really love this technique and have tried it with a number of colour combinations. Essentially you need colours in 4 different strengths - light to dark. I choose to use gold embossing powder, but silver and bronze would work as well
MHC’s trademark of short chapters, cliff-hanger endings, well defined characters and gripping plot deliver yet another interesting read.

the 34th annual sybil ludington 50k on saturday was the 6th time i've run this race over the last 7 years. in 2006 sybil was my very first ultra. except for last year, i managed to make it back every year since. that's despite the fact that each year i repeated swear it will be my last sybil (because of the traffic runners have to compete with over the course). this year it would be my longest run since the mhrrc "recover from the holidays" 50k in january. except for a pair of 30k races last month, i haven't gotten in any decent long runs this training cycle.
Absolutely beautiful don't ya think? Keeping that in mind I thought about what beautiful eyes my daughter Katelyn has, so innocent and naive at the tender age of 7. If only we could keep that innocence!
We have a sequel to “Iron Man” and “Thor” due in 2013 and “Captain America“ in 2014 – the very earliest that we might expect to see an “Avengers” follow-up is 2015 and if Edgar’s cryptic Tweet is to be taken at absolute face value, his much-ballyhooed “Ant Man“ movie might be nearer to being green-lit than previously thought. Which would give us another suitable member of the “Avengers” squad to cheer on in a couple of years, all being well.

Of Lombard towns, or at the least comparéd with the best. The meter and syntax may sound awkward to us today, but educated poets were trained in Latin, the model for all great poetry it was thought, and Latin, especially Latin poetry, allows just about any word order, while the meter was the standard choice for long story in verse. And long indeed it was, for by the time he finished, and got his friend to write an introduction, it was well over 30,000 words.

In most cases, this seems pretty simple. But in many settings as followers of Christ, we seem to think that we are not as legit as other followers if we don’t have a “rags to riches” testimony, experience, or even the idea that God has to pick us up out of a miry pit in order to be validated as an authentic follower of Christ. All of this is contrary to God’s Word and Will. Sometimes the most powerful testimony that a tried and true follower of Christ can have is that they were wise enough to observe the lives of others and determine what God’s will is from that. My testimony of wise decision making is just as powerful as the person whom God almost had to resurrect.
I usually spend a few obsessive weeks trawling the net, chucking money down the Amazon drain, devouring all the information I can on the subject and adapting my life to be totally devout and then someone, somewhere flips the switch and it’s on to the next thing.
My Parppadelle was good, tho I twice doused it with tobasco to give it some flavor. And the Broccoli dish was blander, the flavors no pairing – they’d almost be better as separate side dishes. S. contemplated asking for tomato sauce to be added.. but the wisdom of sending a dish back to the kitchen is a subject we already covered in a previous post (see Minetta Tavern).
Never one to do things the easy way….

I had the most extraordinary encounter today that it would seem prudent to relate it here, despite my objections to anecdotes on principle, as they are by nature frivolous affair and any overindulgence in their practice leads, unerringly, towards moral degradation and an intolerable erosion of one’s natural dignity. Nevertheless, as I say, this particular encounter was noteworthy enough to be recorded for posterity, as I should like to recall it perhaps at some date in the distant future, and do not find it prudent to rely exclusively upon memory. Therefore, I have decided to forego the usual financial narratives that hitherto have occupied these pages in favor of a tale somewhat more dramatic in nature.

and basically you can use anything you want to but your card must have 3 of 1 thing, 2 of another and 1 of another , so for example. you could use 3 papers, 2 flowers and 1 image. That’s just an example though - it is entirely up to you what you use.
I am currently doing an overhaul of said sewing/craft room. It's just too crowded and not functioning like I want it to. Monday I picked up one of these to help with storage, I can hardly wait until someone puts it together.....where is that man?
We repurposed an old atlas and music book to make paper chains and hanging hearts. The paper chain will swag and be hung from the chairs going down the center isle. The hearts will likely be hung from branches in the reception area. I got the idea of the hanging paper hearts on Pinterest.

Hazel Grace is sixteen and has Stage IV cancer which has metastasised into her lungs. She breathes with the aid of an oxygen tank on wheels, which she has named “Philip”. She has been sent to a support group of other cancer sufferers to deal with her depression, which is where she meets cancer survivor Augustus Waters. He is good-looking and charismatic, and the two make an immediate connection.
Quick background on why the pic was taken:
7) Know the difference between a rut and a block. Writer’s block is when you’ve shut down and your tank is empty. In that case, you just need to do something – anything – to change the patterns in your brain (walk away, sing, get outdoors, do some yoga, cuddle with your pet…you get the idea). A rut is more like a false start. This happens when you’re using a bad idea, it’s bad timing, or you’re sticking with old methods that don’t work. Get out of a rut by questioning everything except your ability to get out of it.
So if local councils have to cut back, things like shelters for victims of domestic abuse, public libraries and public loos shouldn't be affected. They should cut their marketing budget, their publication of useless leaflets about recycling budget and maybe their bonus pool. (Recycling isn't useless, but junk mail about it is.)

Gozo Shioda, like most of the founders of the major Aikido schools, was a student of O-sensei or Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido. Most of the students of O-sensei built their own schools of Aikido based on their understandings on the teachings and basic principles of Aikido that O-sensei taught them.
Having recovered from the 4 day class in Chicago a couple of weeks ago I had some "Real World" work to catch up on so I have not had a huge amount of time to work on my house. I did however get the kitchen and breakfast rooms mostly done. I have ordered some wonderful tiny French style "Escutcheons" to use for the cabinet hardware so when you see the pictures you will understand why there are no pulls on any of the cabinetry yet.

Readers hoping Osman will deliver a verdict on gentrification will be disappointed. He is a self-declared “fence-sitter,” focused more on putting the complex phenomenon in a broader historical context, and defining the brownstoner movement within the “polycultural, polycentric and polyhistorical” world that is Brooklyn.

A very small cozy wood-paneled restaurant in the old part of Nürnberg. To enter Essigbrätlein you need to use a doorbell and well inside this 450-year old establishment only 20 seats are available so an advanced booking is recommended for this 2-star (Guide Michelin) Restaurant.
I’ve lost someone important to alcoholism and I can promise you it is no easy road for keeping faith. I thought I understood the illness – great and sober as I am – but trust me, it looks a lot different coming at you than it does coming from within.
Sometimes the sister says, “What Daddy has done to us is sexually abusive,” and we love her for all times, validated or not, for she struggles with her own level of acceptance. We understand. We were “confused” too.
I applaud you and your unsolicited, uncomfortably personal, overly informative, well meaning rhetoric.
A lot of you have been asking for it.
This metaphor of being invited to the table makes me feel like I am still at the kids’ table. I may be in leadership over everyone else at that table, but I am still considered “a kid.” Even if I’m invited to sit at the adults’ table, I’m not really one of them. I’m just a kid with a new seat, closer to the mashed potatoes.
So there we have it - the very first settlers to arrive in South Africa were convicted criminals! How ironic that today, in the year 2011, criminality still rules the roost.
Maddy almost made me puke the other day. I was sitting on the couch watching TV when all of the sudden I smelled poop. I thought she might have been sick and couldn't hold it so I ran around trying to find her mess. Nothing. Then I figured she must have been gassy. Nope. I realized she was licking her mouth. OH MY GOD!! She ate the cat's poop out of the litter box. Barf. Barf. Barf!

This is a thought I find strangely compelling. It seems the deeper we delve into knowledge in the search of truth, the closer we come to the realization that the only knowledge we will ever have is of our own ignorance. What paralyses more than the realization that our actions are driven by false confidence?
Leave the cucumber to drain for about 30 minutes then rinse it with cold water and dry it well with paper towels or with a tea towel.
BOSCHKOP, Pretoria, South Africa, April 11 2009 – A Dutch immigrant couple from the Utrecht region who had emigrated to South Africa in 1982 to run a dairy farm, was murdered on Easter Friday, April 10 2009. The farmer, 63-year-old Johannes van den Bosch, was bludgeoned to death while milking the cows early that morning.
Technically, using crystal malt should disqualify this recipe from being considered a SMaSH beer, partly because it's rare for a home brewer to know what type of barley was used to create the a crystal malt. However, Simpson's recent introduction of Crystal Maris Otter now makes it possible to have a SMaSH beer sweetened by the caramelized sugars of a crystal malt.

Anyhow, speaking of R, it is quite scary/sad to be doing the long distance thing. I can still come back home to Sydney at least once every other week and for holidays, but when I think about how it is going to be like that for 5 years it is rather intimidating. However if we can't make it through this, then we might as well give up now. Which is clearly not an option. I am unbelievably lucky to have him in my life, to have him believe in me unfailingly and support me without question through anything and everything. Do your best, forget the rest. That's all we can hope for.

While it’s likely that we have a set of incomplete stats, I have to say I’m liking the numbers we’re seeing, particularly on defense. As has been the case with the previous two scrimmages, our front seven picked up most of the tackles. This is a MUCH better situation than having our safeties lead the team in tackles. And who knew that three little letters (INT) could bring me so much joy?
TUASON, J.:
Don’t expect the restaurant to somehow chill your wine in a short amount of time. Consider chilling your wine to a lower temperature than you would normally drink it, as it will probably warm up some during transport to the restaurant.
Easter is a vision of what your church can become. Our former Sr. Pastor, Gary York, used to say, "if you can hit it, you can average it". I think that's true. If people will come to church on Easter, then you just have to figure out what might minister to that group the other 51 weeks of the year. I have prayed this morning that God would grow us into the church we saw yesterday. It is also a great way to assess possible limitations, programmatic challenges, staffing/volunteer needs/parking etc.... If God would make yesterday's service a normal Sunday what would you have to do grow into for that to happen?

I first tried Sake about 3 years ago. It was mental and it really messed me up for some reason. After I had my first few sips I felt like I had become instantly drunk - in an amazing way - it was crazy. This beer smells like that. *Danger!* Quite nutty with woody hints, some Belgian dark fruit malt flavours too in the aroma.
I'm still not quite sure how to answer that question.

Each year this event has some sort of theme (don't ask me why, I can't actually remember anymore!! It just does OK!), we've had top ten films, desert island discs, top 10 debut albums etc etc. This year, E.

The rules were simple, all of the tracks had to either:

Finally there are the additions to /etc/asterisk/extensions_custom.conf. We will need to add at least two contexts to that file. The first handles inbound calls from Google Voice. You only need ONE of these no matter how many Google Voice users you have, but you have a choice between two contexts. Remember that at the start of this article I said you had to decide whether you want to answer the call as soon as it comes into your system, or defer answering until a destination extension picks up. Well, if you decided to let Asterisk answer the call as soon at it arrives, then you’ll need to add this context:

Another gold leaf-adorned masterpiece of Goma Dofu followed. The pillowy round of sesame tofu encasing uni (sea urchin) was perched on a small pool of dashi, and topped with natame (a Japanese spring vegetable), fresh gratings of wasabi and of course, a piece of the glittery stuff. It was strangely soothing, with the delicate flavours softly embracing my palate. The expertly made dashi added salt and depth, while the wasabi lent a slight heat that elevated the dish (without blowing my head off).
Ohhh it's Wednesday night again. Well that means I (Michele F.) am here to share with you the WINNERS for our last photo challenge. You are all winners in my book!! But that would be too easy.

First, we did some clothes shopping. We found some great deals on shirts and jeans and pants. Then we hit the home stores and found some great accents and drapes and linen. They were on sale. Even better, my friend had coupons we used to get even more discounts on the sale items. We were on a shopping bliss high, having found so many great stuff for really great prices. The last place we stopped at was the store where I would buy two pairs of expensive running shoes.

Seth stared, open-mouthed and teary-eyed as the only two people he’d seen in days turned their backs and walked away. He stayed there for a long time, trying to work through the man’s words. Finally, when thirst and the need to piss overcame his frustration and fear, he stepped down out of the truck. But before he did anything else, he stowed the shotgun behind the seat along with the cigarettes and liquor. He retrieved his bow case and removed the weapon from the foam interior. Eight aluminum arrows, with their red and white rubber fletching and wide, tri-blade broad heads were snapped into the bow’s quiver. Casting nervous glances around the desolate highway, he knocked a shaft to the string and slid the bow release over his wrist. He set the bow in the passenger’s seat and went about his business, the fear in that man’s eyes still burned into his mind

I will continue to post more pictures and information on spring ephemerals and if anyone is interested, I can dedicate some posts to spring ephemerals and early flowering native perennials. I have also been growing some native perennials from seed and have just put them outside to harden them off in preparation for planting this spring. Here are some pictures of Heuchera americana and Heuchera villosa 'Autumn Bride' that I grew from seed. Not all of them will go into my gardens, some will go to friends and family so they can also have some native groundcover for their gardens. They are in 3 1/2" pots and there are 24 to a flat and this is just a small portion of the plants, so you have some idea of how many I have to plant and distribute! Here are some more plants ready to go out, including Baptisia australis and Rudbeckia occidentalis 'Green Wizard'. This rudbeckia is a west coast native and will do well in most zones of the U.S. and the Green Wizard cultivar is a great looking plant with flowers that don't have any petals just sepals. It looks cool!
"A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse" is one of the best-known lines in English literature, but the real Richard III never uttered them. His last words are among the few things about the battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 that were accurately recorded. They were "Treason, Treason, Treason!"

In recent years pork belly has appeared in almost every restaurant, but long before it became the appetizer du jour, it has been a staple in Asian cuisine. This is one of the Japanese classic recipes that I made recently when my friends and I all got together. My friend MC taught us all how to make Buta no Kakuni! While this dish takes a while to make, it is definitely worth the wait. The pork falls apart in your mouth and it sooo good! Oh and she just started her own blog too! It’s Slow Carb focused, check it out here!
What a lie it is to believe that today is just going to be like every other day. It can’t be with Jesus in it. His “love and life and grace and truth” are going to fill up today making sure that no “today” will be “just like yesterday.” I wonder what we miss because we’ve stopped believing that Jesus will continue to leave us in awe and wonder, even on “just another Monday?”

Blog writers lately have been talking of the winds and yes, they have been strong at times. While in Tucson last year, we picked up some X Chocks for the wheels of the 5th wheel. There are easy to put on as you set up and come with a little handy tool which I also use for the rear jacks. The up side is that the rig does not rock nearly as much with the winds of the southwest!

As a lot of you know by now, my debut novel Remembrance was inspired by Taylor Swift's "Love Story" music video. I talked all about it in a blog entry a few months ago, discussing how Remembrance was inspired by Taylor Swift's "Love Story" music video.

The nagging pains have been bothering me for more than just the enforced lessening of activities… I fear losing focus on the plan and the goal. I have not strayed from eating right. I have been less active and I am trying to measure myself. Am I using the nagging pains as an excuse or are the nagging pains really keeping me from being more active. I have to fight my natural tendency towards sloth…

So Shelly is the story of three friends, all modern-day high school students, based on the lives and personalities of the second generation of English Romantic poets: Gordon, Lord Byron; Percy Bysshe Shelley; and John Keats. After Shelly dies in what’s ruled a “sailing accident,” the other two steal the urn containing her ashes from her wake and attempt to fulfill her final wish to have them scattered on the very beach where her body washed ashore.

So he is still in the country: Zinkhan had been issued a ticket from Delta Air Lines to fly to Amsterdam from Atlanta this past Saturday. Federal agents staked out the gate at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport but that flight came and went without Zinkhan aboard. Zinkhan had a part-time teaching position at Free University in The Netherlands and the school had purchased the ticket for him.
It might've gotten louder as far as I'm concerned. I enjoyed It Might Get Loud but the film doesn't really deliver the goods. Ostensibly a document of a summit meeting of three well respected and highly influential guitar players from three different generations, the meeting happens but the three hardly reach the summit together. There is actually very little footage of the three of them in the same room and even less of them making music together in it. What little music they do make together is fine enough but it's not an especially inspired session.
My experiences involved saving leftovers, but forgetting to eat them or perhaps that means the same thing as avoiding them in the refrigerator… A few times I cooked meals where I had a little left over, yet not enough to save to make anything close to another meal. On one occasion I mis-measured the water to add to my Hamburger Helper meal and ended up with soup instead, which really didn’t seem like a meal I would likely reheat and eat again.
It is impressive.
Back in October I saw this news report about this nurse that was receiving cards of hope for breast cancer patients. I wanted to participate in sending a card but unfortunately could not get mine completed until now. I contacted Nurse Mortl and she indicated to me that she was trying to keep this going all year and welcomed any card(s) I had and encouraged me to let my friends know. So if anyone is interested in making a card, please contact me and I will provide you with the mailing address. So here is the card I made.

The windows lining the lobby of my building streamed past me and in a singular moment everything stopped. The light from the morning twilight caught my eye and I wondered why I was even fighting. Maybe this was my salvation from who knows how many countless more mornings leading to only dull days full of people who would sell their own mother for a chance at fame or a better car or the new I-anything. Maybe in some horrific monstrous way, this thing was choosing to help me in the only way it knew how, savagely tearing me limb from limb. But this moment of deep introspection was quickly over taken by my human instinct to keep living, suck as many hours of life out of this world as you can. You can never have enough time to troll the Internet or cheat on your partner or tweet how much you hate waiting on line at the DMV. So I ran and I kept running, past the windows to the middle of my lobby, through the first door, down another flight of stairs and out into the open air.

Conservatism and cognitive ability are negatively correlated. The evidence is based on 1254 community college students and 1600 foreign students seeking entry to United States' universities. At the individual level of analysis, conservatism scores correlate negatively with SAT, Vocabulary, and Analogy test scores. At the national level of analysis, conservatism scores correlate negatively with measures of education (e.g., gross enrollment at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels) and performance on mathematics and reading assessments from the PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) project. They also correlate with components of the Failed States Index and several other measures of economic and political development of nations. Conservatism scores have higher correlations with economic and political measures than estimated IQ scores.

For ten hours on MondayJacqueline Traide was subjected to gruelling "tests" which included having her mouth clamped open, a strip of her hair shaved off, force-fed and generally tested upon in ways similar to how an animal would be for cosmetic testing.

The base is 8 1/2 x 11. Folded in half lengthwise and the opposite direction in thirds. You and see where I tore one section, punched a half circle in another, cut a diagonal in the third, folded the forth down and cut a little bit of the fourth to create a pop up on the fold!

The interfaith movement is something which I’ve touched upon at various times in this blog, both in its good points and in its bad ones. However, it is to be understood that–whatever the positive or negative aspects of the interfaith movement happen to be–interfaith activities are not exactly the playground of syncretism. In fact, a great deal of interfaith activity occurs in a situation in which syncretism is frowned upon entirely. Some interfaith rituals involve practices, prayers, or actions that are drawn from several separate religious streams, but these do not then get carried on in other contexts, they are one-off matters, and they are often only monotheistic or monistic in their basis and favor religions that operate from those dominant theologies. There are some interfaith churches and groups now that do try and practice hybrid–and, therefore, syncretistic–spiritualities, but they are far fewer than the ones that gather together, have discussions, perhaps have workshops which allow people of different religions to hear about or experience aspects of other religions, but then safely return to their own corners and their own religious views without being influenced by (or, in some negative interpretations, “contaminated by”) these other viewpoints. While engaging in interfaith work should strengthen the respect and understanding between different religions and their practitioners, and therefore is not necessarily meant at all to create new and novel syncretic traditions, it is important to note this distinction. Entering into interfaith work with a strong basis in one’s own religion, and leaving it with a greater commitment to one’s own religion, is not at all a bad thing. Unfortunately, some people see interfaith work as a means of proselytizing to other religions and convincing them of the errors of their ways, and thus it can be a difficult position to enter into, especially for those of minority faiths (as all modern pagans and polytheists are).

I spent from 8-9 cleaning. The dishes needed done, and the sink needed washed. I did some laundry, and spot mopped a few areas in the kitchen. I folded some clothes, and picked up the few areas that the kids missed in their chores. Really, the house looked "company worthy" when I was done. Now, lets see how long I can maintain this - hehehe.

There’s not a word of blame placed on the assailant in the story about this assault. Elsewhere in the paper there is a story about people vandalising street signs, but no one has suggested that it’s the city council’s fault for having street signs in the first place. Instead, the city council is asking the public to intervene, and promising that they will crack down on offenders.

What they can do instead is rather more valuable. There are certain technologies that are either dependent on electricity, or are easiest to provide using electricity, that contribute mightily to human welfare. (Long range radio communication is an example of the first kind; refrigeration for food storage is an example of the second.) If these technologies can get through the present crisis in a sustainable form, they will contribute to human welfare as far into the future as you care to look. Renewable energy sources that provide a modest amount of electricity on a local scale can keep a good many of these technologies going, and if enough people here and now either learn how to build and maintain renewable systems on that scale, on the one hand, or learn how to build and maintain the technologies themselves on the same modest and local scale, on the other, our civilization may actually accomplish the surprisingly rare feat of adding something worthwhile to the long-term toolkit of our species.

And we have men, a particularly egregious subset of Man, constantly in the news for their irresponsible behavior. Not a day goes by that, from some corner of the globe, comes a report that a male has done something wrong. A crazy guy in China has broken into a school and knifed dozens of helpless children. A slacker dude in Berlin carelessly tosses his burning cigarette from a train and starts a fire. A well-meaning husband in my own hometown puts a dirty dish in the left side of the sink when he’s been told a thousand times to rinse it first in the right side, because he should know by now — after living in the same house for 15 years — that’s where the garbage disposal is.
Tip: Do not dress like this...
One of the issues with a broken hand is holding onto the handlebars. I can't put any weight on my right hand so riding in the normal position on my bike would result in a big imbalance with my right hand side bearing all the weight. With the time-trial bike, I rest my arms on the pads of the aerobars in the TT position and everything remains straight. It's pretty hard work for my body to assume the TT position all the time, but I suppose at least it should be beneficial for actually racing time-trials later this year (in particular the Club Championships one in June, which is 30km long). But, for the whinging part, ergos are very mind numbing and frustrating, in particular when the weather is absolutely brilliant (which it has been for about 2 weeks since the crash) and all you want to do is go out for hours on your bike...
“United 93″ is a simply told, near-documentary look at how that fire in the field came to be. As I said above, the film has no message, but if you — as I finally did — choose to go, it will pose you a question: What would you do, an ordinary person in an extraordinary moment when life and death, good and evil, were as clear as the skies over America on September 11? Will you, as so many of our fellow citizens yearn to do these days, stay seated? Or will you stand up?

5. When my kids eat food that has been on the floor.I try to keep the house as tidy as it can, at least for a house with two active toddlers, a teenager and a carpenter husband.I could sweep the living room floor 50 times a day and you would still find cheerios, yesterday’s toast crusts, pieces of apple and goldfish crackers.I do my best to pick up the “old food” but there’s those few bits that will get missed.My kids can get very creative with their hiding spots and getting them a “play kitchen” for Christmas only seemed to facilitate that.When they were little and they dropped their pacifier on the floor in the grocery store, they would scream until it got picked up.But now they just pick it up themselves and pop it into their mouth.So, really now our job is to make sure that what they are putting into their mouth is actually food and is okay. It’s impossible to stay on top of all the germs unless you live in a bubble.

This problem is deeply rooted in our education system. It boils down to classroom shortage, inadequate instructional materials, and undesirable class size. Teachers’ proficiency must also be assessed. No teachers are inefficient nor not proficient to teach the language but it must be stressed that teachers also need to refresh and enhance skills.
On the one hand, you want to ask if it's a bad time (right in the middle of an hour-long conversation) and if you should maybe call them back later, and on the other hand your own good manners prevent you from letting on you've noticed anything out of the ordinary.

Soon the minute is up. It's not that hard to push hard, when I know it will be over in a minute. Once the :59 clicks back to :00, I allow myself to push the down arrow, back to five. Then I get three full minutes of a more reasonable pace. I chant the number I'm waiting for, the number I'll see when it's time to crank that resistance up for another minute. If I ended my hard minute at eight minutes, I start to chant, in my head, eleven...eleven...eleven. And when 10:59 clicks over to 11:00, I crank it up again. I do these circuits over and over.

In fact, I will go so far as to say, if you are only going to write a few articles and then quit, you might as well not write or submit any articles.

Between now and then I’m going to have to continue focusing on my health but plan to also continue writing/editing and working towards the release in September.

It has been several months since we haven`t had to deal with a Monday morning melt-down. M seemed fine last night when he went to bed. Sometimes, inexplicably, we all wake up on the wrong side of the bed. This was certainly the case for M this am. Despite his rocky start, he had a relatively good day at both school and daycare. He was in a good mood tonight and didn`t kick up a fuss when his electronics time was over or when it was time for bed. Although M`s melt-downs are furious, they don`t to tend last very long and usually blow over relatively quickly. But like most storms, M leaves a trail of mayhem behind him. In this case, two bewildered and weary parents.
All that being said, I do appreciate the immense trouble that some hotels go to in creating a soft centerpiece for their rooms. Some resemble a fine sculpture, maybe something from Alexander Calder but without so many pieces hanging on wires. Travelling on business, I’ve been fortunate enough on many occasions to plop down after a long day of work and get lost in the giant mound of pillows. I was once reported missing to the U.S. consulate in Chennai, India, until a maid found me the next afternoon. It was like I had died and gone to Pier One Imports.

I have to say, I thought that it was a nice idea from the moment I read about it, but it was really amazing to see it in action once we were on "set." The photo shoot was held at a private residence in San Diego. The staff could not have been more nice or more welcoming. I am seriously an even bigger fan of Infantino products now that I have met the incredibly sweet and sincere people behind the brand.

It was really a neat day.

One guy in particular caught my eye. We actually he caught a bunch of our eyes because he had on a Michael Bolton shirt and ear muffs. One of my coworkers friends went up and tried to get the shirt from him and he instantly said."I am not retarded." Just in case we thought he was due to the ear muffs and Bolton shirt. We then played Lovers and Friends for him which he knew every word to. He basically made my night with that saying. His girlfriend was a good sport to as we egged on his asinine behavior.

Out of respect for that mother I declined to pursue the scorched earth strategy that a few compatriots put forth, an endless series of amendments about every genetic disease we could find with increasingly harrowing personal stories about each accompanied by vituperative declamations against any who disagreed. See, I do have some sense of decorum.

What happens in a Cornered Cat class? Lots of great stuff! In this two-day class, I work with people who are already basically familiar with their guns and help them reach a more confident skill level, so that handling the gun comes much more naturally to them. What do you do if the gun doesn't fire when you expect it to? How do you reload it efficiently? Can you stay hidden behind a doorway or a piece of furniture and still hit a bad guy? Can you hit the target while moving away from danger, or in low light? Should you even try? These are the types of questions we deal with, because they teach us how we might use the gun in the real world, not just for plinking at the range. These are tough topics, but important ones. After all, the real world includes innocent bystanders. We owe it to them to learn real-life skills, so we don't endanger others when we defend ourselves.

Well, first of all, I’m sure you’re all saying “Why weren’t your dogs leashed?” I don’t know. My dogs are horrible on leashes. We live on 40 acres of freedom up here so they aren’t leashed at all. They respond (typically) to command and stay within the reach of my voice. Today, there were so many people down there fishing, it was so exciting to them to see these visitors in their “home” that Takoda was acting a bit off. He quickly straightened up though.
9. THE PENSIONER PIRATES OF MARINE PARADE by Jonathan Broughton
Well hope you like my little piece today and I hope to see ya back here soon.
Back in early April, we received an e-mail about a local private school needing players for their soccer team. When a school is so small that their graduating class includes all of 6 students, it's difficult to put together a team big enough to have people on the field and on the bench. By opening up the roster to local home schoolers, they were able to make it happen. I replied to the e-mail by saying, "I think the Frog would like to participate."
After the first few minutes of walking around and getting used to the initial expressions of bafflement I actually begin to feel quite comfortable – the pink slippers are particularly soft. Most of the facial expressions I glimpse seem to suspect banter rather than anything sinister. And it’s easy to see how you could spend the day in this clobber.
The court recognized that the reproduction and distribution rights are different, but I fail to see how that recognition played out in the court’s decision: how is the transmission of a work the distribution of a copy? I have no problem with holding the first person liable for making an unauthorized copy, nor with holding the second person liable for making one too via plaintiff’s transmission, nor do I have any problem with holding the second person liable for making an unauthorized copy via plaintiff’s transmission even if plaintiff’s copy was lawful. And I understand why copyright owners want to stop people from putting works in share folders so that they whole world can have access to and therefore make unauthorized copies. My issue is that they can still sue the person who retrieves the copy (and the first person if his or her copy was unlawful); but the law shouldn’t be mucked up to go after the first person where the first person possesses a lawful copy. The consequences for such a making available right go well beyond the facts of these cases.
For over the past three years now there has been destruction and construction going on in the block next to the building where I work. I've been watching with much interest how it was all taken apart, how that huge hole was dug, and then filled in with different construction.

With all this balance sheet stuff it feels like I'm turning into my accountant brother. Sends a chili down my spine.
We all have those places in our hearts, don’t we? Hidden attitudes. Hidden sins. Hidden hurts. And we’ll never be healthy and whole until we start to open those areas up to Jesus.

The release opens with the excellent short instrumental Litrosis, its brewing and sinister ambience a rousing battle cry and epic introduction to the sounds ahead. Epic horns, vocal harmonies, and an atmosphere announcing a titanic force ahead, lead straight into Insomniac’s Lullaby. The song ruptures defences with blistering riffs and a scorching melodic guitar before rampaging with full intensity across the senses, trampling them under foot with devastating rhythms and grizzled venom spraying vocals. It is a reasonably expected type of black metal attack but with insurgent and imaginative solo and guitar meanderings which impress deeply.

Here then is a revised 24 card deck (normally 22 cards) that I put together for possible future use with low level characters. Read it over and see what you think. Please be sure to leave your suggestions in the comments for other cards you think would also fit into the deck. Maybe we can get the total cards up to 30.
The Mechanoids appeared in the comic TV 21 which featured a strip based on the Daleks, but in which the Doctor did not appear. The Mechanoids are the sworn enemies of the Daleks and a third race, blue-skinned humanoids, have to try and subtly interfere in order to keep the peace and prevent a war.

As parents we can find ourselves frustrated by the lack of speed our children have in getting tasks done. When we are tired of waiting or really need something done right now, we may find ourselves saying “Never mind, I’ll do it!” It often takes less time and energy to simply do it ourselves. However, when we jump in and do something our children should be doing, we are stealing the opportunity for them to increase their self discipline and sense of responsibility.
Revelation 22: 18 “I (Jesus speaking) testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book. If anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues which are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life and from the holy city, which are written in this book.

Dr Christopher Hufeland, Goethe's doctor, warned in 1806, ‘The physician should and may do nothing else but preserve life. Whether it is valuable or not, that is none of his business. If he once permits such considerations to influence his actions, the doctor will become the most dangerous man in the state.’

I decided to check out the shoot on the day and was basically just a general assistant. I don’t know how she did it, but Jade managed to find the most perfect clothes and accessories for her ”Mermaid Out of Water” concept. Mostly all from second-hand stores! (Yes, we love that). My particular favourites were the shimmering gold skirt, the perlemoen shell bra, and the big blue goggles. The model, Nicky Fraser, was also unbelievably perfect for the mermaid role, with her wiry, curly hair and long slender physique, she was stunning!

A few months ago, at a council meeting, when residents were complaining at the withdrawal of funding for school lollipop crossings, Brian Coleman went off on a Grade 1 rant about the appalling inconvenience of temporary traffic lights, and he vowed to ban them in the borough, forcing companies to replace such arrangements with hat doffing labourers holding stop and go signs, bowing when the Coleman saloon approached, and waving him through with a cheery smile and an obedient salute.

Well, most of the recipes are ones buried throughout this site, but now you can find them all in one convenient place (and you know how I'm liking convenient stuff at the moment). I've also revamped a few and added new photos. To top it all off, there are some more unposted recipes, my favorites being the Devil's Food Cupcake versus the My Little Angel Cupcake (my take on a mini raw angel food cake, seen in this pic).
Psalm 34:17… “The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles” (KJV). Here it is, my favorite motto… “In the heart of man… a cry… In the heart of God… supply…” I have it in my heart to put this motto on my car license plate. Put it in your heart…
One of the most important steps in this “makeover” process is to check the expiration dates on all your food products. Some of those canned goods you stocked up on during a big sale or before the threat of bad weather may be expired. If the dates have expired, toss the food. (Please check the dates before you donate your extras, since expired food is no good for anyone!) Also, consider cleaning out your fridge during this process; checking on expiration dates on the food items in there. It’s amazing how long salad dressing seems to linger in the back corners of refrigerators! Many food items don’t come with expiration or use by dates, so you’re wondering how to tell if those items are still OK? A great resource is the website StillTasty.com. Simply enter the food item to see how long it will stay safe and good tasting.
So why does this matter, this apparent vanity run by a celebrity candidate? Because I can envision a scenario where Roseanne Barr could take enough votes from Obama to cost him some states which would ordinarily be safely blue states, or purple states where it might be really close. Some that come to mind include-Oregon, Washington, Vermont, Minnesota, New Mexico, Colorado, Florida, Virginia, and even the President's home state of Illinois.

Honestly, I’ve seen episodes of SCOOBY DOO that are scarier, and therein lies my problem with CABIN. As a horror film, it’s simply not scary. There is nothing at stake here. Every time the action shifts from the cabin to the control room, the audience is pulled away from any growing attachment it may have developed for the victims. Without fear and tension, there is no horror. Call me crazy, but I’m still looking for a horror film that scares the shit out of me – much like THE EXORCIST or HALLOWEEN or THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE or SCREAM or THE DESCENT did. I’m old-school like that.

I’ve been to two T20 games at ANZ stadium this year. A Sydney Thunder game that was rain effected but that drew 30,000. And last nights blockbuster international. Both events were really enjoyable. In fact, I walked out last night thinking it can only be a good thing if we see more international cricket at Homebush.
Next came time for the demonstration of making chocolate using the traditional tools. The Mano and Metate are used to grind the fermented, roasted partially ground cacao beans into a chocolate paste. These tools can be compared to a mortar and pestle in function. The form is different as the metate is a horizontal tray upon which, through a specific technique, the beans and nibs are crushed to make the chocolate paste. At Cyrila’s Farm the mano and metate is made from basalt, a volcanic stone material that has been handed down through the generations.

My PSP was challenging at first, and I had a rough time finding motivation 3 weeks in, but this experience makes me feel like I am not careless. I feel accomplished that I admitted I had a problem, or that I was wrong by doing something, and I fixed it. Now, doing these daily things feels natural to me. It’s a habit I will continue to add on.

It is my understanding that this is down to a lack of communication not necessarily a lack of interest on the part of people in the affected areas in Newport, who basically were not informed properly if at all. I am also aware that local ward Labour councillors appear to have been personally informed by the Welsh Office by email in 2011 but appear not to have passed that information to local residents.

It’s a credit to our profession that journalists everywhere work long hours additional to their contracts, largely to uphold standards and quality output. I hope our strike action will raise awareness of a dwindling press as a whole and encourage fellow journalists to fight for better journalism. After all, none of us chose this profession for money, so if the quality of your publication isn’t worth fighting for, what is?

Do you have any idea of the waste of time and effort this represents? I could have saved us a lot of time and aggravation by just buying the bagels at the store, ripping the bag open and throwing them on the floor before I left the store, at least they would have done the clean up part. Or I could have saved even more work by simply throwing the money on the ground before I entered the store.

Thank you, my dear husband, for not calling me crazy (even though I thought I must be crazy) when I first mentioned the idea of homeschooling 21 years ago. Thank you for supporting me when I was a working mother of one infant with one on the way and I was commuting 3 hours a day to my job as a Navy lieutenant in Washington, DC. I was always exhausted--emotionally and physically drained--but you never scolded me for a messy house or a lousy dinner (a most attractive feature which you display to this day). You always tell me how gorgeous I am, even when I don't feel gorgeous. You have always given me everything I ever desired. I could never have been a mom to ten or homeschooled for even one single day if it weren't for your great love and support. Thank you for being my helpmate and companion these past 25 years.

In Broadcomm Corp. v. Qualcomm Inc. (Sept. 4, 2007), The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third circuit held "that (1) in a consensus-oriented private standardsetting environment, (2) a patent holder’s intentionally false promise to license essential proprietary technology on fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (“FRAND”) terms, (3) coupled with a standards-determining organization's ("SDO's") reliance on that promise when including the technology in a standard, and (4) the patent holder’s subsequent breach of that promise, is actionable anticompetitive conduct."
This is a community issue. Let’s look at it from the perspective of one child in one class. Have you ever wondered about the root cause of a child’s behavior? The disruptive child in your son’s class may not be a bad kid. He may be hungry and struggling to concentrate. He may be anxious, reflecting his parents’ anxiety about being unable to provide nutritious food at home. Imagine the positive impact — if this one child could become food secure, he/she could thrive in school, improve social ties and the entire class can benefit. Now replace the word “classroom” for “community” and the possibilities grow exponentially.

Unsure of what to do, I get the bright idea that I maybe, just maybe should open a window. But, I really don’t want to go in there with the crazed bird that for all intents and purposes has diarrhea. So, I stand transfixed for a few moments watching the poor creature fly from perch to perch. And I realize something… I am the only one with the power to free this poor creature. This bird cannot help itself. I have to go in there and DO SOMETHING. And do it quickly before more diarrhea escapes and lands on my beautiful leather sofa.

Traditionally, performers have been desperate to gain the attention of the press, and many people have exploited that desperation. Even now, many performers are briefed that they ought to be desperate for press attention, and ought to value the opinions of one reviewer more than those of hundreds of audience members.
Another theory suggests that the painting was hidden because its subject fell into disfavour. This fits well with Marlowe, who enjoyed a fraught relationship with his college. Corpus Christi refused to grant him his MA because he had not merely been absent during term, but rumoured to have been at the Jesuit seminary in Rheims. Given the religious turbulence of the time this was outrageous.

Crossing the Canterbury Road (a Roman Road according to the map, presumably from Durovernum Cantiacorum to the Weald, via the roadside settlement at Westhawk Farm), the path follows a direct line across a field of rape, drilled directly into the stubble.

Ibis put his belongings on the floor saying, “Of course, of course, I’m delighted to help,” and took the heavy bucket in both hands. The barkeep lumbered off picking up two other buckets exiting the Inn, and Ibis, looking around, put his bucket on the floor, slung his backpack and bow over his shoulder again and walked without demure out of the Inn, down the snow-covered trail, and back to the bridge where the party was waiting. He did not notice a pair of pretty blue eyes from a second story window watch him as he trundled himself away through the snow.
Grady also still loves his media. Out of all of our kids, he is the one that loves media the most...TV, movies, Leapster/video games. And I love his variety...he loves a wide range of things. He of course has my heart :) because one of his very favorites to watch is Little House on the Prairie (was always my fave growing up...still is). He also loves Anne of Green Gables...I think he just loves a good story in general of real life people...and that's a great story. When the girls are watching a Barbie movie though, he'll join right in (they do have good storylines and good always wins out over evil of course). He loves old cartoons...like really old...like black and whites. And while Joel was gone I gave him a treat. Some of the nights, I would put them down for bed, then I'd let Grady get up and while I took a shower he would watch...Star Wars. He'd been asking for a while so I got the cartoon ones, Clone Wars, for him to watch. He loves them. He is all into the story of it all...his friend Michael has told him lots of what the movies are about. He found out the other day that one of his favorites ends up dying. He went to his room and grieved a little bit...like a couple of tears worth. I love the way he just lets the emotions come and show and isn't afraid of that. ;) Sometimes while reading our books for school, we'll all three have tears streaming down our faces, but esp. me and Grady. ;) (Yes, our homeschool books are really that amazing)

“What’s in it for me?” It all depends. If I come to God as I would a profane business transaction—demanding that I receive what I have earned—then what’s in it for me is disappointment. Why? Because even if I could earn God’s blessing (even if I were one of the ones hired at 6:00 AM, which I am not) I would receive only what every other person in God’s Kingdom receives, regardless of when he or she was brought in.
John 3:14-21 (NKJV) And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God."
These innovative designs translate to many different styles, which means that you will be able to find Sherri Hill dresses for almost any occasion, except perhaps for field hockey or horseback riding. Bridesmaids' dresses are guaranteed to be unique and fresh, while still flattering the form of any woman that must wear it. If you have ever been a bridesmaid before, then you are already aware of how important it is to find dresses that flatter anyone, as well as how rare it is for that to actually happen. If you have an awards banquet to attend, then there will be no problem finding something that is a bit more subdued, while still including that kick of style that gives you the confidence to stand out from the crowd.

The point is this: the good news Paul proclaimed to the Corinthians (and we assume he did likewise to other peoples in other places) is essentially the story of Jesus. Paul’s gospel was the sequence of events that, in this telling, begins with Jesus’ death, continues through his burial, resurrection, appearance, and ascension.

Yes, I could leave magic more free form. It was going to be like that, not really taking center stage. But magic and the societal laws regarding it both make a big difference in what happened in the past to the wizard, what happened to the girl, and what will happen in the future to both of them and the society they live in. The wizard will have to use magic, and magic will get used against them. Which means now I really have to define it.
Spent most part of the ride with the bike parked and glaring at the view, then headed to Nariman point to see kids skate and then back.

Well, let me tell you that you mean so much for me and I have no answer for your question, friend. One thing that I know is, I’m happy to be your friend and you don’t have to care about whatever people think about you.

Yesterday afternoon at 12.51pm a devastating earthquake hit Christchurch and outlying areas. I grabbed Sian, the only of the midgets that was at home, and cowered under a doorway, it was hard to run, the ground was very very violent.
Ana and her husband moved to Los Angeles five years ago when the TV industry came calling back. They thought they had escaped it all when they moved to Playa del Carmen in México to act as irresponsible beach bums, but the offer was too tempting to pass up. Three years ago, they joyously welcomed their daughter into their bilingual and bicultural family. These days, Ana Lilian is splitting her time as a brand consultant building bridges with Latina bloggers, a freelance writer and TV producer, and dedicating precious time to her labor-of-love blog for parents raising bilingual and bicultural children: SpanglishBaby .
Forgive me y'all, but I'm a little shaken right now.
Last year, Bill Gates, investor Warren Buffett, and Mark Zuckerberg (of Facebook fame) signed the "Gates-Buffet Giving Pledge" in which they promised to donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has already donated $28 billion dollars to charity, and they have pledged to eventually give away 95% of their wealth. A lot of wealthy people don't do that; in fact, few wealthy people do that. One of the criticisms in all the love-fest following the death of Steve Jobs was the fact that he didn't seem to be much of a philanthropist. Of course, I remember someone telling prospective philanthropists "do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing." You really do have to admire people like Bill and Melinda Gates who have made a second career out of giving away what they accumulated in their first.

Fact is, Old World’s beers evolve. Two weeks ago Matt made a note on the beer menu indicating that the Dark Knight was now rating a higher abv percentage than originally advertised. An early attempt to brew an IPA got out of hand as I recall but it was interesting to stop in from week to week and taste how the beer was developing and changing. To those who still crave consistency, my advice is for you to go down to the corner swill house and order a Coors, Miller or Pabst – just don’t expect the barkeeper to allow you to taste a free sample before you plunk down your bucks. So far the guys at Old World will set you up with a taste of anything you fancy trying before you pay for a full glass.
She read my texts and when she got home today she made me very sorry that I had sent them. Very sorry! She then stated that she was going to start giving me maintenance spankings twice a week from now on, on top of any discipline spankings that I may earn. I will keep you informed.

Voices from your past fade after a while, but just the slightest little thing can bring them back. I'm sure everyone has remnants of a long lost voice singing somewhere in their soul. I hope the voices in your head and in your past are as pleasant as mine.
There is not a marriage so far gone that God can not restore it. There is not a broken relationship so crushed that God cannot mend. There is not a financial crater too deep that God cannot help you crawl out of to level ground. There exists NO situation where His Grace is not sufficient enough to carry you through. Oh, the world may tell you that you need to listen to your heart, or do what is best for you, and go forward and not look back, but God says something quite different and He is the One who we can trust to tell us the Truth. He says:

Feeding the Gods is a big trip, where time has run away with itself and men ‘meant’ to be dead are very much alive, some doing odd things. Franz Kafka has clawed his way into the dressing room. P.B. Shelley has all too obviously lent Hamilton part of his stash. Plentiful alcohol has also crept into the genesis of these pages. In between the ears of this Scott Hamilton, who does not play rugby at all, but reads a hell of a lot, there is something divergent; a mythopoeic morass that seeps onto the page with a flurry of quick-shuffle images and juxtaposed heroes, and above all, a vibrant social conscience...Scott Hamilton, the non-All Black who has never met Graham Henry, exists in a strange sociolinguistic ethos in comparison to most of his Pakeha poetic peers, in an extra-intelligent terrain unexplored by most of his fellow citizens...

She was tall and beautiful with long brown wavy hair and dark blue eyes. There she stood under the big clock at the Hotel Astor in Manhattan. “Hey gorgeous, how about a movie tonight?” The young woman smiled as she glanced back up at the clock. It was five minutes to six and her date would be there any minute. His name was Ray Ravelli, and he was a professional boxer. Tonight there would be a lot of stopping on the way to dinner, because everyone knew Ray when he walked through Times Square. As the clock struck six and the bells gently tolled, she saw Ray walking towards her.

In order to keep up with wire products demand, a wire drawing facility was built in 1980 within 3 miles of the main Franklin Park plant. This plant draws wire for threaded rod, u-bolts, eyebolts and various other wire forms, including special products requested by customers. All the wire drawing/forming is done here using exclusively USA made steel.
And oh how he knows it. Von Steuben takes himself seriously because no one else does. His womanizing at the lodge is apparently an annual thing: a conquest of both the women and their men. He seems motivated by nothing but ego. Unlike the protagonist in Foolish Wives, shot by Von Stroheim three years later, there is no suggestion here of a villain in need of money, or protection, or in the grips of nymphomaniacal or sociopathic impulses. There is only a little man who hates himself.
I was brought up as an only child. The reason my parents adopted was due to fertility problems on my Mum’s side. They had waited a long time and tried to conceive, unsuccessfully. They were almost too old to adopt when they started looking into it but luckily they got through the processes and were accepted. I couldn’t have wished for a better Mum and Dad!

As with all communities, there are always those who express unhappiness or do not like the decisions being made by a board. Many times this personality is one who complains but does not offer solutions or act to make a difference by volunteering. Whether the issue is upgrades to common areas or an increase in assessments, some folks will never agree with or support the actions of a board. On the other side a board must act in the best interest of the entire community, regardless of individual opinions. The board has a fiduciary duty to uphold.

I received my esthetician license last year and have been working full-time as a Beauty Advisor ever since while still managing to bartender a few nights a week. I'm tired. I'm cranky. My heart is no longer into crafting cocktails for a thirsty public well into the wee hours of the night, especially since now I have to get up at 4 am for my day job. Getting up early really takes the magic out of everything.

Now I know the power of Prayer and Meditation because I’ve seen enough Miracles in my life and do know they are very real and very attainable with love being the guiding force. Do not look at the picture and say “Oh No it looks bad” rather look at the picture and focus the black spots away with love and with compassion. Visualize and Pray for Healing and Dissolving, put your energies there towards “Miracles and Love” for another human being and his entire family. Thomas served in the Army, he put on the uniform for you, the least we can do is put our hands together and pray for his health to be restored. Send your love, your thoughts, your Prayers and Meditations to Thomas and his family. He has an Uncle TJ whom is very ill and trying to recover as well. Let us lift them all up in Prayer and show our devotion and determination with compassion but most of all with Love… Many Thanks to each of you, I love you all so much, together we can help this family heal ~Lynie with Bring In Light~

Do you agree that Wikipedia’s rankings are fair? And lets face it, even if they’re not (unless you’re Google of course) what can we do about it other than try and compete.

Do you watch House of Lies? Do you enjoy watching anti-heroes?
Why? Well, the fish thing is obvious. The letters – shape and sound – in Kikxis are spiky and sharp; the letters and sounds in Baroom are round and soft. The music-colour thing seems obvious to me, too, but may seem less so to others. But when you think properly about the ways in which we naturally describe sounds, it’s not so surprising: a voice, for example, could easily be sharp, thin, thick, rounded, soft, hard, light, heavy, dark, warm, cold, rich, bitter. And many words can be attributed to different sensations. “Sharp” can be taste, shape, or touch, for example. Extend this to describing a voice (as I do in Mondays are Red) as buttery, melting, or tasting of apple-purée and it’s not much of a stretching of the imagination.
This is my town.
But when Thor relaxes a bit to foreground the visuals, what visuals they are – Asgard is beautifully imagined, down to the subtle mix of modern and historic in the costuming (check out Loki’s amazing horned helm). The 3D, something that I’m generally only a fan of in the service of something as stupid as Drive Angry 3D, is surprisingly understated, highlighting a handful of seriously dramatic images. Branagh has also packed his cast with ringers, from the obvious (Stellan! Sir Tony!) to the subtle (Idris Elba and Colm Feore are perfect in their small roles). Chris Hemsworth acquits himself well, though I did find myself wishing that they’d thrown a couple more members of the Skarsgard clan in there, if just for fun (Alexander would have made a perfect Fandral). In all, it’s a decent popcorn flick, and it will definitely be interesting to see how Thor’s ego will mesh with that of Tony Stark and the other Avengers next May. And maybe Joss Whedon will give us a little less chatting and a little more smiting.

To finish off there is a nice statistical summary of 2011 by Heather Morrison, Simon Fraser University School of Communication, who calls it ‘the year of open’. It does certainly seem that way: “There are over 7,000 peer-reviewed fully open access journals as listed in the DOAJ, still growing by 4 titles per day“. Noted journals include PLoS ONE, PubMedCentral, arXiv, RePEC, and E-LIS. It seems that there are “over 2,000 repositories, linking to more than 30 million items, growing at the rate of 21 thousand items per day“. For many the open access model is the only way forward and this requires some people to do a lot of rethinking.

We passed this sign at a creperie, which translated "galettes au boeuf" as "beef pancakes." I doubt they're big sellers with the tourist crowd. The translation doesn't really work, plus it sounds sexual. I'm pretty sure if you walk into a place and say, "I want to eat some beef pancakes" you're going to get either a punch in the face or somebody's phone number.

A narrow win by Mr. Obama would be thanks to bungling by Mitt Romney and the Republicans, because based on the president’s record alone, Mr. Obama has richly earned a pink slip from voters.
But think about the power of giving "just one more" to your family. Sometimes as a parent, I feel completely overwhelmed. The demands on my time, my energy, and my engagement are significant, leaving little for me and often even less for my partner. We strive for balance and often achieve it for a time, which is wonderful for all of us. But my kids need me, and I do just about everything I can to answer that need because I know that the less I respond, the less likely they are to keep asking. The last think I want to do is alienate or isolate my children, especially when my reasons for saying "no" are because I feel like I have been stretched to my limit. When I am in a good place, there is always a little more I can give to them, to myself, to my partner. It doesn't have to be a lot, it doesn't have to be earth shattering. But it doesn't need to be. My kids aren't asking for the moon, they are asking for just one more. Can't we find a way to give just one more?

We were introduced to Alvin Martin, Parish Manager, who was so very helpful in showing us around and identifying some of my unidentified old family photos of Sam's work that matched with some of the pieces in the church. Being Jewish, I'm not that familiar with some of the names of the pieces and what they represent or symbolize. Alvin was quite helpful in explaining. The pieces of the puzzle were starting to come together.
Everyone is different, and yet, deep down, stripped of the superficial, we're all the same and we can all relate to great joy and great pain and it is in the joy and pain of races that I'm humbled and reminded that I'm just like everyone else. The camaraderie of the pre-race corral, being cheered by strangers, the struggle through the rough spots and the thrill of the post-finish bagel line - all in the anonymity of spandex - put me in touch with some of the most basic pleasures of being human.

It is an appalling state of affairs that today the South African ruling party in this country actively endorses and promotes the image that the “Apartheid Regime” was defeated in military battles. These arrogant Marxists (bastards) have completely forgotten that it was the leaders of the United States and their own buddies in Moscow who decided that Cuban troops will be withdrawn from Angola, and Soviet military aid would cease, as soon as South Africa withdrew from Namibia. South Africa also agreed to hand control of Namibia to the United Nations after a tripartite agreement was signed between Angola, Cuba and South Africa. How does one hand control of a country over to someone else if you didn’t occupy it in the first place?

Campaigning: For each full adventure which a character survives, the probabilities of a given attack causing a shortage of ammo / charge and a jam / failure increase by one degree, e.g. from a double 5 or 6 to a double 4, 5 or 6. At the discretion of the GM, the increase for the jam / failure may be avoided through maintenance, represented by a successful Repairing action of average difficulty per item taken between adventures.
The problem with the new translation and indeed the notion of a codified Latin Mass at all is that it destroys the communal and egalitarian nature of the act. Rather than an act of communion through which the churchgoer relates to God, it becomes an individualistic act through which the churchgoer relates to "experts" in Rome. It sets certain people above others in terms of their knowledge of a dead language and of dogma -- concerns that clearly distract from the message of God. If the Mass has any meaning, it must be grounded in communal concerns and vision-- not an effort to include as many four-syllable words as possible.

I would like to, but, for reasons I will explain later on in this post, I still haven't made up my mind. I have, however, followed with great interest the wave of protests, uprisings and insubordination that has engulfed the world in the last twelve months.

For the Relish:
The results of this process have been mixed. While adjusting to living in a new country was, for the most part, exhausting, it was also a fantastic distraction from the people and activities I missed. But, as over the past few weeks I began to develop mindless habits and routines, I also started to feel trapped in the city. I realized how much I missed small, seemingly unimportant things like cycling, UW classes, or Thai food, and I couldn’t seem to replace them with Chilean equivalents. I don’t mean to imply that life had been monotonous – two weekends ago by chance I met the local cycling activist group, to my knowledge four members strong, at a dubstep party. The following week I turned in my first paper written in Spanish, which, given that I write roughly a page every three hours, took quite a while to complete – but instead that I had been starting to feel normal yet in a manner that was slightly lacking.

I promote a few authors everyday through Facebook where all it takes is a click of the ‘SHARE’ button. I also write reviews for those authors who have peaked my interest, and whose novels I have read. I involve myself with the everyday subjects that come up on FB as well. Being friendly and keeping a smile in my words helps with building relationships online as well as potential readers of my work. I believe we all can use a hand-up in the literary world where there are so many obstacles to keep us from reaching our dreams and goals. The mere mention of a title or an author can prompt curiosity from a potential reader, not to mention noticing the fact that it was YOU who mentioned it. Your support will not be overlooked. The way I see it…it’s a win, win situation.
The tide quickly changes for Valentin when, in 1929, he is informed by a studio executive, played by John Goodman, that the studio will be focusing exclusively on talking pictures. Indignant and in denial, Valentin sets out to produce his own silent film, convinced the public will love it. At the same time, Peppy gains popularity as one of the studio’s new stars of Talkies. Their new pictures debut on the same day, with unsurprising results, which, coupled with the stock market crash, leaves Valentin on a downward spiral of alcoholism and depression.

For few glorious weeks this became my reality. To be fair, I should mention that he is the one guy I didn’t meet on Match.com. I met him on another site. Okay, okay… it was a site for hook-ups. I had just had one of the longest dry spells EVER and I knew I didn’t want a relationship. This was pure, unadulterated, unapologetic rebounding.
The quilt top pieces were laid out in a random pattern based mainly on what appealed to me.
Once you have received Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour, the Holy Spirit dwells in your heart and you belong to Him forever. It is very clear that there is nothing that can remove you from the love of God (Romans 8:38,39)), and you are sealed until the day of redemption. There is a judgment for Christians which will take place immediately after we are “taken away.” That judgment has to do with our life on this earth and we will be rewarded for those things which we have done that have been pleasing to God. 1 Corinthians 3:12-15 tells of this judgment and even if you have no rewards, your salvation is sure and you will enjoy the glories of heaven for all eternity.

I suppose one fundamental question here might be: Do architects need less regulation in order to pursue the art of spatial design – or simply more creative rules?

Based on the Channel 4 investigation, young black men of Afro Caribbean origin are committing more than five times as many gang rapes as young white men. However, the discrepancy is far greater than that, given that people of Afro-Caribbean origin are estimated to make up around 6% of the population, whilst whites are around 80% (down from 90% in 1999) by these figures, which nobody has disputed, their propensity to commit gang rape exceeds that of white youths by thousands of percent. (Perhaps someone better at maths than I can provide an accurate percentage.)
With few options left, Erin begrudgingly accepts Clay’s help . . . and it just might be her undoing.

I caught the CBC’s “The Perfect Runner” last week on “The Nature of Things with David Suzuki”. Great documentary on how humans have survived and have evolved to become the perfect long distance runner.
Unsurprisingly the main concern of our politicians is not the innate degenerative processes of authoritarian systems, but how to restore public FAITH in those systems… and, more importantly, how to restore FAITH in the mouthpieces of those systems.
Respect should be something that begins at home and carries along to all other facets of life. Modeling respect is one of the best ways to earn respect from your students. I know that as an adult, if I am treated respectfully I am going to treat that person the same way in return. (of course... it is much harder to treat rude people (HUGE pet peeve!!) with respect, but they deserve the same :) The problem is... our kids come from so many different walks of life. Mom, Dad, grandma, cousins, etc. might not be present in your students' lives. Consistency is so important, especially at this young age, to reinforce these life skills. WE as teachers might be the only consistency our kids have from day to day.

How do you ask someone an objective or hypothetical question as an actual objective or hypothetical question, and not as a question that leads to a conversation related to yourself? I have a friend who asked her guy friend if she was dateable. She did not want to date him, but truly valued his opinion and was interested to know it. So he leads with “Well, I wouldn’t date you, but here’s why…” She got his opinion, but in a way that was insulting to her.

The reality is that power comes from acting as a group, in the interests of that group—as La Raza, the Umma, and the Tribe all demonstrate. Blindness to this, like almost any blindness in nature, is a weakness and leads to extinction.

Just a quickie, I know you’ve been reading for ages now. The school we work for is a business and as such it’s crap. Money comes before proper education and TPR (Total Physical Response, which is an approach to teaching) is used as a verb. Our fees are the highest in the city and the school considers itself to offer a premium product. This is what they mean by ‘premium’:

As not only a fan of Japanese animation and comics, I also have a profound interest in Japanese history so I certainly love a good series that takes place in a time when samurais roam the streets of an impressive city then called Edo. Of course, this means I have seen my share of anime and read more than enough manga titles that take place in this fascinating period so imagine my complete delight when I heard that NIS America was bringing the anime version of Natsume Ono’s critically-acclaimed manga. Oh yeah, the Premium Edition of the Complete Series of House of Five Leaves is everything a fan of the series could ask for and one that shouldn’t be missed.

The only things that I wasn't fond of, was that even when Fran decides which boy she wants, she's still willing to kiss/hug/snuggle with the other one. Which is, I might add, very heartbreaking. The last fourth of the book dragged slightly, and most of it is build up for book two, I think. There are supposed to be three books to this series, and I'm still very anxious to get to read the next one. (The only problem here, is that this one hasn't even officially come out yet. -head desk-)

What better way to look at body image and self-perception than by looking at a story everyone knows pretty well, and one of the oldest stories around that deals with looks, Beauty and the Beast. Alex Flinn has made this story a lot easier to discuss for this subject by having her re-telling, Beastly, set in modern times, with characters we can all recognise, and with the beast telling his story.

The okra was tender and came with a few other vegetables which was a nice touch and for once the fish in the fish curry didn't taste fishy nor was it rubbery. The food was very spicy in general the way we've asked for it to be and the rice came in decent portions for the price.
Digital publishing is only just entering it’s infancy in the Netherlands, and it remains the single area holding back independent publishers and self-published authors.

I am an admitted pessimist, but my gloomy mood is actually rooted in something different from the caustic cynicism that has dominated the past two decades of popular entertainment. This is frustrating because this gloom and ironic gloom is a pessimism that trains be to identity as positively what they should probably reject in themselves. The writers at the rather enigmatic blogger at Spass ohne Grenzen cut to what I like to call “pessimism” of the will, which masks itself as an ideology of the gleeful ,ironic every-man:

The problem with Path is though that it currently has about 798 million less users than Facebook. No one I know was on it until I convinced a few of my friends to try it out and the fact is a social network is only as good as its network. But with such an interest right now on sites with design at its core like Instagram and Pinterest it wouldn’t surprise me one bit if Path comes more and more to our attention in coming months.

Well, a new meeting has finally been scheduled, for 6 PM Oct. 25 at Long Island College Hospital, 339 Hicks Street (at Atlantic Ave.). The intervening months have given both side more time to prepare their cases. The developer, which is working with the City, is L&M Equities. Their aim is to create a total of 152 new housing units across three sites: 75 Columbia Street; 86-98 Congress Street and 79 Warren Street; and 104-116 Warren Street and 101-115 Baltic Street. (Why two addresses are considered a "site," I don't know.) One of the buildings that would be torn down is the old Hamberger Christmas ornament factory on Warren (above), which would break the heart of every romantic east and west of the BQE.

Despite the evidence that air quality can be improved by careful selection and siting of trees in urban areas, there is little evidence that urban greening projects take account of how air quality goals can best be achieved. Worse still, a lack of investment in the management of urban trees is undermining tree cover in urban areas.

Not too long ago, I couldn’t say exactly when because it’s been a gradual process, there’s this new thing where people share a picture. But it’s not really a picture because it’s words; just in a graphic form. Usually it’s some kind of “funny” saying (I put that in quotes because, to me, they are rarely amusing) or inspirational claptrap. But other people like them, so it gets shared. Or someone else finds the original and shares it again. Over and over and over until all I can see is a stream of crap that I have no interest in.

The current cultural difference between the Afrikaner & Boer can best be summarized with the following: the Afrikaner is neo colonial & tends to view all White Afrikaans speakers as being all part of the same group regardless of cultural distinctions while the Boers were & are anti-colonial / republican / independent oriented & view themselves as a distinct & separate entity from the greater White Afrikaans population as they are descended from the republican Boers & the Voortrekkers who were themselves descended from the frontier pastoralists & Trekboers who trekked away from the Western Cape centuries ago where the ancestors of those who would control the later emerging Afrikaner designation remained. This is an essential component to understanding the different outlooks within the greater White Afrikaans speaking population.

Well, my hubby and I put the Beans in her pack in play and did a workout routine together in the field by our house. It was a good workout and I am still a little sore from it. I failed to wake up early this morning like I wanted to start doing because I didn’t get to bed until pretty late. I need to rectify that big time. If I am going to be working out regularly, I need to have a better sleep routine.

Among the amendments that did not pass and were therefore not included in the final House budget was an amendment that would have provided the new Court Administrator with broader authority to transfer funds within the Trial Court. Currently, transferability is authorized across the Trial Court departments, but restricted relative to Probation and Community Corrections accounts. Transferability from the latter two line items from another court line item cannot exceed 5%. The amendment would have removed the restriction and allowed transfers between any line item within the trial court to any other item of appropriation within the trial court as deemed necessary and appropriate for FY 2013.

This too is why the Manager is a dying breed too. Managers are in reality factory assembly line foremen who job it is to meet the quota and the rules of the process. Theirs is not the job to think of new ways of doing things. Their job is to keep it all moving and the sheep from straying. But with fewer sheep, who needs the manager?

Cyrano de Bergerac (Franca Squarciapino)
From my reading of the letters and now these m’s, I’d argue that much of what is found in the Juvenilia is read into them; I’m not saying the diabolic and anger is not there, but that it was not consciously intended or admitted to. Like her family, Jane Austen deflected the satire, anger, resentment of her texts; the family called such passages “nonsense” or neutrally “vigorous;” Austen described it as “fun,” delightful, and laughed.

Anyway, all of you are the ribbons on my year. Thank you for the inspiration, the support, the encouragement, the new directions and the success I've found. It's not measured in dollar signs at this point, but in winning over some grains of sand to my beach. Thank you for joining me on this adventure. I can't wait to see what 2012 brings for all of you. There's an amazing amount of talent out there and I'm fortunate to rub elbows with a lot of that great talent.

I’m not saying that one or any of the current GOP candidates fits this bill perfectly, although some come closers than others (*cough*Bachmann*cough*…that will sound better on the podcast)…but these are principles of America vs. those of the what now passes for Europe (although the UK might just pull out and join us in principle, God bless David Cameron). Every time, every election, every level. We are at a cross roads and we cannot afford to choose anything but America.

I've made heaps of jewellery, but I'm looking forward to a point in time when writing gets less hectic so that I can wrap some presents, make some cards and do some general "prettifying". I also need to do a little sewing and baking. If I can just hold out a bit longer!

In the September of her sixteenth year, there was a great tournament, not only for those who fought, but also for those who played chess, and five stones, for cooks and winemakers, for inventors of great inventions, for storytellers and jugglers and bards. In fact, it was for anyone who was any good at anything. Snow Woman was determined to be the best at everything, for the king had announced that whoever won the most competitions would get a great prize of gold and jewels.

Moreover, once a petitioner has challenged the validity of a patent through a PGR, that party may not challenge validity in a court proceeding based on any ground it raised during the PGR. Additionally, a party who has challenged the validity of a patent in court may not file a PGR petition on any grounds they raised, or could have raised, in the district court. Because the district court action allows the challenger the full panoply of discovery (unlike the restricted discovery appropriate to the more limited PGR proceeding), the Committee believes that it is only reasonable to apply estoppel to claims the challenger was, or should have been, in a position to raise, whether or not it did so.

Aha more Pakatan red tapists! This article seems innocuous enough but it’s intent is CONTROL of the voters again. Look here ‘councilmen’ the GUIDELINES do not exist if the Rakyat say so. The Rakyat does not have to be aware of anything the BN guys wrote in some airconditioned office 20 years ago that Pakatan now throws at the voters that the Rakyat will never wanted to go along even in 1993 with nor wants to pay their tax funds for. Who the hell are the people who wrote the so-called NUISANCE rules? BN. Why the hell is Pakatan throwing these BN written rules at us without amendments?

We've purchased all our furniture from craigslist and never worried about bed bugs before - now, that's all I could think about.

Finally, in August 2010, there was a big international conference at YIISA, including over 100 presentations.

As Fox News’ Doug McKelway wrote in August 2011, “Obama has suggested that blame for the stagnant U.S. economy lies in places other than the Oval office. The latest example occurred Monday when the President said, “There will always be economic factors that we can’t control, earthquakes, spikes in oil prices, slowdowns in other parts of the world.”
Last week a company called Planetary Resources, Inc. announced its intention to develop the means of exploiting minerals from near-earth asteroids on a for-profit basis. This news got some attention for its novelty, particularly at a time when the concerns of most companies are distinctly earthbound. It also attracted sneers from some in the financial press, though the author of a particularly scathing analysis in the Financial Times seems to have confused recovering material on the scale of a NASA space probe with the kind of large-scale mining that Planetary Resources contemplates. I don't know whether there's a pony in there or not, somewhere down the road, but there's certainly a larger message to be gleaned: The company's announcement serves as a useful reminder that the earth we live on is not a closed system. Anyone interested in truly long-term sustainability must take account of that.

In the northern county of Yorkshire, 10% of people of working age are now unemployed. The percentage of people out of work varies across the UK, but not vastly. Once the powerhouse of the entire UK, and by extension the British Empire, Yorkshire was transformed from a natural nation with a strong agrarian population, into an urban centre with vast wealth for the rulers, and abject poverty for the masses. Yesterday's Budget is but another step along a path to the annihilation of natural living and human dignity; it does nothing to lower unemployment, or to help those who are out of work in any part of the UK.
At the Vatican, Borgia’s called aside by della Rovere, who tells Borgia that, if he were a different man, della Rovere would vote for him. Borgia’s been a good vice chancellor, and the skills that made him good at that would serve the papacy well, but Borgia’s also lacking in honesty and other qualities della Rovere thinks are necessary in a pope, so he plans to fight Borgia to the end. Borgia calmly says he tends to win any battles he fights, but after all, this is in God’s hands.
By contrast the brutal Fomorians are out to exploit nature, rather than be a part of it. They had features “hanging like seaweed when the tide is out, their tongues the colour and shape of cormorant tongues, the clamour of the ocean their talk”. Their arrival in Ireland saw "forests cut down, rivers rerouted, towers everywhere, it was soon clear it must come to a fight.” (P28).

Then the book splits and tracks the impressive, two-month long manhunt. Despite being led by the King-hating J.

Perversely, the exorbitant pricing schemes drove people to the domestic draft taps, where beers were cheap and extremely tasty. There was an 2008 imperial stout from Stone aged in Elijah Craig barrels that they were giving away for $2 a glass. Lompoc's 2010 vintage of Old Tavern Rat was a mere token (pint price: $4).
Weeding means you have to pay attention to detail and not pull up the good stuff or kill your roses – I do have roses around here somewhere. I’ve been yearning to sit at the desk all week; there will be lots to do at the scanner so I should be over there in my wheelie chair…and when I’m in poetry mode I want to sit at a desk and scribble in a pad. So, I will switch on my head to sort out this mess, flick on that little light and focus on clearing that space for me – the orchid, and then I can bloom.

I have found that quarterly meetings are the best for keeping happy participants. More often than that can get overwhelming quickly and less often and people get out of the routine. I liked February, May, September, and early November. It misses the summertime and major holidays and if that's what you always do, people will know to gauge their time accordingly.
The other dwarves are lined up to slide down the slopes to the dragon. Remember that these are 12 foot high slopes, about 60 degrees, but they are covered in ice and you will slide easily. Also remember that ALL movements on the blue level will demand a dexterity check, and failure indicates you've slipped and fallen. You can throw anything 2 lbs. or less from a prone position on the ice, but you must take a round to stand up before you can attack with weapons. It takes a round because it is sheer ice and as such it is slippery. I will let you attack while laying on your back if the creature is directly above you.
I wish I had a portable web-cam. You know, one that is fixed in front of my head, sort of like that torch on a coalminer`s helmet! When I am taking excursions, I could then take you along and wouldn`t have to tell you all the details or take photos (my camera is still broken anyway), but you could switch my web cam on and walk with me! Well, people would perhaps throw weird looks at me (us), because I was wearing that stiff helmet but that won`t bother us. When I was sitting on a bench in Hamburg`s main shopping street last week, there were suddenly loud shouts, and then I saw a man in a cow costume running down the sidewalk, with another man in a cowboy`s outfit who swang a knife, running after him. People looked up, saw it was just a joke or whatever, and then continued after their own business. So my helmet would not raise attention, either (and YOU could have seen that cowman running - I did think that was an extraordinary sight, but then I am living in a small town now!).

Bin Laden agreed with the proposal and a courier was dispatched to Iraqi. But unknown to bin Laden, the courier also carried a letter from Zawahiri detailing bin Laden's condition and requesting Iraqi's help in convincing him to retire voluntarily for his own safety. The courier returned from visiting Iraqi in September 2003 with cosmetic modifications of the plan, and with the advice that the shura had requested: bin Laden should be housed in a secure location from which he could issue orders, but Zawahiri should continue to act on bin Laden's behalf in the day-to-day affairs of the organization.

Much more delightful is the silken tofu with pork floss and century egg, a textbook example of triumph with simplicity. The cool block of slippery tofu is a textural contrast against the fluffy wads of sweet and salty pork floss and the puddle of sweet soy. Wedges of century egg add richness, the jellied whites tinted a glossy amber with a pungent yolk of grey that is sulfurous yet alluring.

There are no penalties for abusing animals on fur farms in China, which is the world’s largest fur exporter, supplying more than half of the finished fur garments imported for sale in the United States. Foxes, minks, rabbits, dogs, cats, and other animals pace and shiver in outdoor wire cages, with no shelter from driving rain, freezing nights, or the scorching sun.
Understanding that most managers do not feel they should babysit their employees, I am not suggesting that you create an expectation and micromanage it. Rather, I am suggesting that you set an expectation and then let your employees know that you meant business - you didn’t create a rule just to create a rule. You asked them to follow a procedure because you know that it will increase efficiency or alleviate unnecessary stress or, simply, is just the most effective way to get work done. When you check back, you will tell your employees that you care about them following protocol. Then, most importantly, you gain productivity from your staff and in turn, a higher profitability.

The Household Charge is an interim measure only and a comprehensive and equitable valuation-based property tax will be introduced in the next two years.The Household Charge is €100 per residential property this year but it is thought it will rise in years to come.The new charges will be payable as a one off payment online or by post or by quarterly direct debits.This Household Tax will have to be paid before March 31st in each year of liability to avoid penalty charges.All Owners of residential property in Ireland will be liable for the charge on each residential property they own as at 1st January 2012.No bills or invoices for this household charge will be sent,the charge will be on a self declaration basis.The definition of a residential property includes – house, maisonette, flat, apartment or bedsit. So the owner of a building split into 5 bedsits will be liable for five lots of Household Charge.A building is liable if it is occupied, or suitable for occupation. An empty house will not be exempt.Registration and payment can be carried out online on the HouseholdCharge.ie website. Payment by Mastercard, Visa or Laser accepted. There will also be an option to fill in a paper registration form and pay by post or in person at your local Council Office before March 31st.Forms should also be available to download or collect from Council Offices.Late payment penalties apply as follows:Payments made within 3 and 6 months of January 2012, a 10% penalty.Payments made between 6 and 12 months late, a 20% penalty.Payments more than 12 months late, a 30% penalty plus 1% interest per month.So if someone is 12 months late paying the €100 household charge, they will owe €130 plus another €12 interest – a total of €142.If charges remain unpaid a charge will remain attached to the property.The Household Charge is expected to raise about €160 million a year,but there will be costs incurred in administration and collection of the charge.

At almost forty? Nothing. I used to dislike my ears and my forehead. My ears stuck out when I was twelve or thirteen and my forehead was too broad.

I guess some would say my 12, almost 11, and 4 year olds are deprived. None of them have a personal phone. None of them have an ipod. None of them have a gaming system - either personal or family-sized. We don't even have a TV! When the economy tanked in late 2008 we did what we had to to survive. We moved from a 3000 square foot house to a 1500 square foot rental to the 1000 square foot home we currently own. My three kids - gasp! - shared one room for the first two years we were in this house! My two oldest children even received free lunches from February 2009 through May of 2009. And they were a godsend. However, while on these free lunches we weren't buying souped-up cars, any electronics, cigarettes (that now cost around $5/pack! - I remember when they were like $1.50!), etc., etc. It is all about priorities. Why should someone else have to pay for my child's food because I am unwilling to? Note I didn't say unable - those people need help for sure.

Remind your child that, if the adult still does not listen, it is not his or her fault, but to keep asking until someone does something to fix the problem. Tell your child to please always tell you whenever she or he has a problem with anyone anywhere anytime. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of adults to create safe environments for the children in their lives and to be good role-models for our children by acting as their advocates in powerful respectful ways.

It took all I had to not turn around and to refrain from breaking into a run. It seemed imperative to be confident, to not show fear, to NOT turn around, though I was tensed for the smallest of noises which might indicate that they had even merely turned around to watch me go, their prey; I consciously identified as “the prey” during this ordeal. I heard the single crackle of a twig but I did not turn around, instead I laughed into the phone at some pretended bon mot. The tension was achingly palpable and I feared that to run would blow my confidence act and trigger a chase, if they sensed fear they’d know I was meeting no one on the trail, my charade would collapse, so I continued the “call” all the way to the parking lot and then, suddenly, I was running to the car, shoving Jamoka in the back seat, and hitting the button that locks all the doors.

This is not in any way an attempt to kill anyone’s dreams. If you are writing and making the income you want to from writing, that’s great. However, if you aren’t making as much income from writing as you would like, perhaps a strategy like that would allow you to hold onto your artistic integrity (however YOU see that) and create more income so that in the long run you can devote more time to the thing that you really love. I’m assuming that at least part of that thing you really love is, in fact, writing.
What is your purpose in this world? What dreams has God given you? What visions do you desire to achieve? That is the vision I speak of. That is what you are to write down. Writing the vision, dreams, and goals of your life is not only an encouragement to you, but an act of faith.

The first book emphasises key skills applicable across the humanities, and key concepts which you will apply through the course. You will explore the origins of the ‘idea’ of material culture and approaches to describing, classifying and interpreting objects, drawing on the disciplines of archaeology, history, anthropology and ancient history. The first chapter introduces the key concepts of ‘object biography’ and the ‘life cycle of things’, by considering how late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century museums attempted to order and classify objects from across time and space. Chapter Two develops skills of close observation and description, considering different ways of writing about objects. Chapter Three broadens out to consider ways in which the historic, social and physical (or archaeological) context of objects can aid in interpreting them, focusing on the House of Menander at Pompeii as a case study. The final chapter focuses on classification, with reference to the study of ancient Athenian vases.

According to Sir Alex Ferguson, Wigan will leave The Emirates with all three points if they score.

They have not hence their annual relegation battle.
Dealing with the lack of care from the ‘caring’ profession has been almost as hard as dealing with the injury. Knowing in your bones that you are ill, but its not being acknowledged or taken seriously is, as many people sadly know, extremely distressing. In my case, if I had received the appropriate care on the day of the accident and in the weeks immediately following, I feel sure that I would be closer to recovery now and that the past eight months would have been more bearable. It was only after seeing three different doctors over the course of the year that I summoned up the resolve and mental energy, in November, to go to a fourth GP and ask for a referral to a specialist. This week, at last, I saw a neurologist. He made it clear that I should have been referred to neurological specialists on the day of the accident or as soon as possible thereafter. It is, he said all too common for significant brain injuries to be overlooked by primary healthcare professionals (your GP, in Britain) and for patients to have to cope alone, being eventually – if at all – referred to neurology months too late to be helpful.

A fortune cookie I read the other day said, “Cleaning up the past will always clear up the future.” Much of my grief has been about cleaning up the past — coming to terms with small every day betrayals, with dreams that never came true, with leftover worries. I have cleaned up the past, gradually worked through those conundrums. What is left is the habit of dwelling on the past, and that I can let be. It does neither of us any good.

I decided Sherlock Holmes would be a great test subject for my foray into using an electronic reading device because, out of all the (public domain) classics, it seemed one of the least sacrilegious to read on a screen. Holmes was pretty up the to the minute, technology wise—he wouldn’t be offended by being read in digital form, would he? (Yes, I worry about these things) Also, they are short stories, so I would only need to survive the kindle for short periods of time.
There’s another word you may be unfamiliar with. McGuffin. In terms of a story, a McGuffin is a plot device that has no explanation but pushes the story along. Cite Pulp Fiction for example. That suitcase’s contents remained a mystery, and they remain a mystery to this day. Some say it was Mr. Wallace’s soul, some say money, some say a cornucopia of violent Russian pornographic magazines (I have some sick friends) but the fact was that no one in the film revealed what it was and no one watching knew what it was, but it pushed the film forward. And that meant it was important, right?

We not only have the issue here of inequality before the law (i.e. special treatment for Muslims), but also the issue of rights; does the right of Muslim women to wear their veil whilst driving really trump the right other road users, pedestrians and general infidels have to be safe, to be protected by the law?

PP is now offering underaged girls lawyers so they can get secret abortions? Who's paying for that? It would be nice to know that no taxpayer dollars are going into that kitty. As the parent of two daughters, this enrages me. This movement to help our underaged daughters obtain abortions in secret has to stop. As mentioned above, these surgical procedures bring risks because they're surgical procedures. If nothing else, parents need to be notified so they can care for their daughter on a medical level, not to mention the many emotional issues she might experience. The problem is, notifying the parent would give them the opportunity to talk to their child and help her make an informed decision. Yes, they might be angry. Maybe disappointed. Definitely sad. But for the majority of parents faced with this dilemma, the health and well being of their daughter outweighs it all and they help and support her.

Paul told his audience in verse 5, that his job was to bring the believers to Jerusalem to be punished. How would this be done? They would be scourged, beaten with rods, forcing them to deny the Lord. This would result in blasphemy, a verbal degradation of deity. This is what Paul admitted in Acts 26:11. “And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme.” He was trying to force his own belief upon them.

She believes strongly that a multicultural dual-language education is one of the greatest gifts we can provide our children, and that effective family literacy is heavily dependent on the availability of stories and literature to which people can relate culturally and realistically. “Literacy and literature cannot be realistically separated if we hope to have an impact on all of our residents,” says Tafolla. “Powerful stories that reflect our reality reverberate inside us, and give us meaning. Literature cannot afford to be elitist or disconnected from the community.”

OK, I could go on and on, but I run the risk of losing some of those who are starting to get a nagging, uncomfortable feeling. Let’s get rid of the nagging and make sure it is a full-bore deliberate uncomfortable feeling instead, and grade those papers. Get out your red pens, gang.
This was for a friend's birthday. She'd gone through my Jan Stawasz book and dribbled over the jewellery, so I thought I'd have a go. The pendant is the "Christmas Ornament" from Jan's book (with an extra-long beaded picot added to thread it on the necklet), the earrings are a one-off from me. The beads are only plastic, but they look nice and irridescent.

First, the cost of downloading an article has never been lower than it is today — on average one fifth of what it was just 10 years ago. As the effective price paid per journal accessed has decreased, the number of journals accessed has increased, and the usage of those journals has grown by over 20% per year. We have invested heavily in making our content more discoverable and more accessible to end-users and to enable the research community to develop innovative research applications. Perhaps it shouldn’t be a surprise that in a study published by the Publishing Research Consortium, which Elsevier’s research team help conduct, 93% of university researchers report that access to journal articles is “fairly easy or very easy.” The full report is available here.

My husband and I wanted to go to Italy and ended up in Holland on February 7, 1992. I should have known that our trip to second time parenthood would be bumpy as we were told that our second born was to be a girl. “Two girls, so nice”, my OB-GYN told me. Guess what, we had the first boy born in 28 years in my family when he arrived via emergency c-section. Not breathing right. Sugar too low, heartbeat too high. I could already feel the “plane veer” off course.

Besides Sheltering in Place there’s other reasons why a kit for when staying home makes sense. Expanding the kit just a bit makes it applicable for various other scenarios, many of them much more probable than an NBC terrorist attack. Thinking of tornado and earthquakes, your home may suffer structural damage which you would need to patch up as well as you can until proper repairs can be made. Having plywood pre-cut for windows before storms hit is common practice for many in tornado country. In sieged Sarajevo, plastic sheet was used to shut windows that had been blasted after the city was shelled. What if a tree smashed through the living room leaving a huge gap opened or you have to pull someone out of the rubble after a quake?

I don't even realize that I'm doing it, which is precisely how it happens. (I find that most things happen without anyone realizing.) Before I know it, I'm covered in raw spots- on my head, my face, my arms, my chest and the bottoms of my feet. My husband can pretty much tell how I'm feeling by how many bandages I'm wearing, which I like to think is pretty handy. He tries not to mention it, because that often makes it worse, but if there are more than two, he usually buys me chocolate.

I didn't come in here very ill. The crohn's was broadly fine (well as "fine" as it ever is...) but I'd been getting chest infections for months. My local hospital didn't want to know because all my notes and specialists were here in Cambridge, 130 miles away from home. It became clearer and clearer that I needed a whole MOT of tests and investigations, so the only way was for me to have them done as an in-patient up here.

These cheeses are what bind together the common thread of society. As each cheese is different in taste, texture, feel, flavor, smell, consistency, sharpness and mildness they are still derived from a common element, milk. True, it may be sheep, goat, cow or buffalo but each final product began as a piece of grass or grain that was eaten and turned into milk. It’s that common beginning that brings us together to realize that each human on this planet is like a unique piece of cheese.

Heberg next recorded a tie with Boston before defeating New Jersey, Buffalo, Chicago, St. Louis, Tampa Bay and Carolina to finish the season 7-1-1, creating some excitement in Pittsburgh.

May 1st, 2012 marks the 236th birthday of the infamous Illuminati and the timeline surrounding and leading up to this date is filled with death and violence. It is also important to know that dates and numbers are extremely important to many of these people. The Occult calendar from April 19-May 1st – exactly 13 days, the number of regeneration and wonderfully significant – is to contain a blood sacrifice to the “beast”. April 19 is also believed to be a day requiring a Fire sacrifice, which is appropriate relating to the fire (sun) gods of Baal, Molech, Nimrod, Saturn, etc.
And every evening, after my ten-hour workday and two-hour commute, the 19-page lists and shopping carts - printed with Epson ink costing $67 per milliliter - are shoved in my hand before I can put my purse away.

A new Planned Parenthood clinic opened in Ferndale officially today. And of course, what should be a momentous occasion for affordable and reliable healthcare in the Metro Detroit area, was marred by protesters who are more interested in their ideology, than the practicality of the thing they are protesting against. I really don’t understand this sudden and unbelievable war on women that’s going on in our country and I certainly don’t understand the backlash against Planned Parenthood. So much of what they do, a vast vast vast majority of what they do is basic healthcare for women, that a great number of locations don’t even perform abortions. But still, in droves these zombies show up to protest against, what one would think, is a basic right for women.

In Jonah Lehrer’s “Groupthink The brainstorming myth,” he spends a lot of time talking about how he doesn’t think brainstorming works… but maybe if he had brainstormed with some colleagues, he could have made his point in two pages instead of six.

However, the game then has to walk the tightrope of tonal dissonance. Whilst maintaining its black sense of humour and self-awareness, it also has a very dark and serious storyline at its heart. The game opens with a flashback to the murder of Max's wife and child, in a sobering and depressing level. Then we flash forwards to the present day, but Max's mind remains locked in that house and in that time. On one occasion Max is captured and beaten, and he returns to that house in a dark nightmare sequence. Far worse is a drug-induced fever later on, when the walls stretch out to infinity and he has to find his way through an endless dark chasm, following trails of blood and the screams of his wife and child. It's one of the more disturbing things I've seen in a game (still) but it works by showing us that the game's central protagonist is seriously psychologically damaged and obsessed by an event that he urgently requires closure on. Hence the increasingly insane lengths Payne goes to as the game progresses as he seeks an explanation and then revenge. There's also Payne's rejection of the notion that he is a hero and that he is acting from altruistic motives: at one point he destroys evidence that could have helped clear his name, simply because he has no interest in anything outside of his desire for revenge. Thus the game's storyline and characterisation (often tacked-on excuses for violence) are key in propelling the whole thing forwards and involving the player in the action.
4) I am 30 and my lifelong love affair with mixes is as strong as ever. It started with mix tapes, then mix CDs, and now we’re in the evolved world of mix “playlists”. Instead of the dates and seasons that used to serve as titles for my old mixes, I now have playlists with titles like “bachelor party”, “Tahiti”, and, my current favorite, “Hangin”.
I think part of what I have come to realise is that I can achieve anything on my own – I have to, there is no-one else to pick up the pieces – but that sometimes I need someone else just to be on my side, to give me a hug, tell me its all ok, and to tell me I look amazing (even when I don’t!).

Which lineup, then, played here? I have no fucking clue. Do I ultimately care, really? No, because the music's stellar.
But one we do remember was called 'parent and child' meal because it consisted of both chicken and egg. Another meal was cooked in a large pot which is placed in the middle of the table for us to help ourselves, eating it with rice. The pot is choc-full of vegetables and meat swimming in a tasty sauce or broth. As always there are the many interesting, tasty condiments to have with it. In Steve and E's case, the vegetables in the dish come from her parents' market garden. Beautiful, healthy vegetables that are a joy and honour to eat.

There is a very accurate stereotype that if you go to a Chinese food restaurant– practically anyone, there is an unspoken rule to all employees to give take out orders only TWO packets of duck sauce, but an unlimited number of soy sauce packets.
I can recall coming to this conclusion/awareness when Maddie and Max went to preschool. I would come home from work and hear stories about what happened at school. It dawned on me that they would have many thousands of life experiences without me. Until that point, I thought I would be part of every aspect of their lives and see and feel everything they did. It came as a rude shock when at 5 they were already, in a sense, on their own and experiencing life without me. It was at that moment I knew that my role had changed. I was simply a caretaker to watch over them as they did their own growing into adults.
So this is pink. Very pink for this 'all about the earthy tones' girl. But I love it, and that's what matters right?!
out from my thoughts,
So here’s the cat’s vow: I will not get sucked in again with first novels in a series that promise the sky… ends up being a disappointing endeavor anyway. Also, I probably made this out to be worse than it actually is. It’s a bit thriller, a bit adventure, a bit of paranormalcy and a whole lot of romance. In all of this, this is a book that reminded me of Rachel Ward’s Numbers, and a lot of people also seemed to like that one. The cat, though, is through with these generic type of books. Why not focus on female characters that are not so stereotypical in their gender roles, especially when you give them freaking special brain powers!
My brother and I decided a while ago that when it came to coming up with a title, we would both brainstorm and write down ideas – any and all – that we could think up over, say, a week. Then we’d send them to each other and decide which were our favorite. Then we’d talk until we both decided on one that we felt fit the book (though I have final say, my brother is as creative in many ways as I am, and his ideas usually have good reason behind them).

There is an awesome feed store about a mile from our house where I buy all our chicken feed and the flock blocks (which are made by Purina for those of who have never heard of them and asked me about them in a previous POST). The owner is a kind, generous soul who really cares about his customers.
The majority of people clustered toward the far fence, but there were enough people close by to make for some great photo ops. Especially as the competition time drew to a close and the winning hauls weighed, the entire event turned to fun. I remain astonished at the number of young men who will put a live parrotfish in their mouths for a photo op. Many people came up to me and inquired where I was from, welcoming me warmly when I answered. It was a very convivial atmosphere, with lots of laughter, smiles, and camaraderie.

We're trying to go camping this weekend. We have two nights reserved with two families we love, and are hoping so hard that the patchy rain predicted this weekend is heavy on the dry and VERY light on the wet. Pray for us, won't you?!

She might surprise us all!

Even though poor black South Africans under the Black ANC government have (a) lower per capita income and educational levels than they did under the white apartheid government; (b) lower life expectancy than they did under apartheid goverment, and (c) higher infant mortality than they did under apartheid government, (d) have to compete with currently anything from 3 to six million African immigrants for jobs, and accordingly have massively higher unemployment rates, and poverty than during apartheid; Nelson Mandela has not considered such a massive reduction in their socio-economic status important enough to even launch a public debate ‘liberation struggle’ against the oppressive ANC black elite government of domination by a corrupt elite.

A little later the nurse checked me again and I was dilated to 9cm & they wanted to break my water. Earlier when I was only 7 cm the midwife had wanted to break my water as well to speed things up but Dan refused & was insistent that she not. When they again wanted to, we called Dan (who was waiting upstairs in our recovery room) who said to wait some more. Thankfully they let me get on my knees, allowing gravity to help break my water (up to this point I’d only been on my back!). It eventually broke some, but not all the way. The midwife kept saying that if she broke my water it would speed up the process, and eventually after calling Dan again and him coming down to the floor (not into the room), we decided to let them break the rest of my water.

What Paul doesn’t mention in his tutorial is there are two types of polarizer filters: Linear and circular. Linear polarizer filters do not work well with digital cameras, so professional photographers recommend using circular polarizers instead.

“A federal judge who spent a decade presiding over one of the most contentious environmental court fights in the Northwest — the fate of endangered salmon in the Columbia River Basin and four hydroelectric dams that interrupt their migration — has said in a recorded interview that the dams should be removed to help the fish. “I think that we need to take those dams down,” the judge, James A. Redden of Federal District Court in Portland, Ore., told Idaho Public Television in an interview for a documentary to be released this summer. “And I’ve never ordered them, you know, or even tried to order them, that you’ve got to take those dams down, but I have urged them to do some work on those dams and they have done it.”

Our observation is that he has one foot standing on the old testament and the other foot standing on the new testament (and I used to be in that place 2 or 3 years ago), and that’s probably why his posts usually sound confusing due to his belief in a mixture of law and grace (or a mixture of the old covenant god based on illusion of separation and the new covenant Father based on unconditional love and oneness).
Oh I have definitely enjoyed my first day of 'holiday mode' in HK which was spent eating Vietnamese with a friend and then mooching around the shops with my aunt. It's definitely been nice to experience working in HK and while I expressed my desire to stay a little longer in my last post...it's something that is certainly do-able in the future but not right now. High on my list of things to do when I move back home is to find a job in London and move there pronto. I suppose I'm lucky that I get to come back to HK often and I know the next time I'll be back will probably be with my parents and sisters in tow, maybe in a year or two! But let's not jump ahead too much, I still have a few weeks which means lots of lunches, meet ups and shopping with friends and family. Excellent.
I have no idea how to judge a "good" acupuncture clinic from a bad one. Although I think there's something to it, possibly, I'm not way into alternative medicine. Given the time constraints, I didn't exactly have time to do a lot of research, either. My due date is 17 days from today! And I went 4 days early with Miss M! I called one place (the woman is also a doula, so I felt good about her), and the woman is out of town. I called a second place (a place with a fancy address and a pile of staff who have very impressive pedigrees), and they had someone available tomorrow afternoon. So, I went with that one. The guy who will be doing it graduated from a 5 year Chinese medical program and has written actual research papers on using so-called Eastern medicine to complement western medicine. Hopefully, that makes him qualified to burn some herbs near my toes.
Life has it ups and downs. Just like a rollercoaster. Everyday can bring new challenges, new peaks and new valleys. We stand in line to start our day, just like we stand in line to ride a rollercoaster. When the day is over we end up, pretty much in the same place we started, just like when we get off a rollercoaster. What is crazy is a lot of us face our days like riding a roller coaster in reverse.

Triumph! Success! And, as if this weren't enough, Bisou--whose training I'd decided to postpone until I had Wolfie in hand--put herself in boot camp on her own. I noticed that, when I would give the down-stay commands to Wolfie, she--who had never gone down unless enticed with a treat--would get a serious look on her face and lie down like a little statue until I released them both. Now, when the guys in boots come tromping through, she holds her stays like a champ. And she has done this while getting as much petting as ever--I cannot keep my hands from this dog--and without having to wait at the door until she makes eye contact, because she always makes eye contact. But then, she is a Cavalier.

The price of not talking about these processes or encouraging children to become independent is very costly. Youth who are continually forced to comply with social stereotypes may develop behavioral problems or depression. Like adult transgender persons, they may also become estranged from family relationships. Youth who become disillusioned with their families may end up homeless and at risk of victimization and disease. Some may commit suicide, leaving others with no explanation or insight into the pain they were suffering. As adults, those youth who were not permitted to give voice to gender identity issues may find themselves in tremendous anguish later in life. Tragically, these children frequently become the very stereotype the parent had hoped to prevent…a gender conflicted adult who self destructs careers and relationships as well as their own children.

A certain someone has been harassing me for a loping video. I finally figured out how to manage it since there's never anyone to video for me, and I set out to accomplish it today. The video didn't turn out as well as I had hoped because the sun was shining at the camera lens and I had to position it pretty far away to get most of the arena in view. The problem with "most of the arena" was that all the good stuff happened outside of the camera's view. I still might post it, but I might end up trying again, and hope for better results.
Even as Commerce Minister Anand Sharma asked Islamabad to expedite the process of granting the Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) status to India, the Pakistan Cabinet today postponed a decision on preparing a negative list of items for trade with India.

I have tons of notebooks and folders stuffed in drawers from 1997! I claimed for years that I’d go back and write those stories but those notebooks are still in my bedroom drawers covered in dust. LOL! I realize now I have no intentions of revisiting those ideas because it’s been over a decade and if I was going to write those stories, I would’ve. So it’s time for me to bite the bullet and throw all that junk away.

That brings us to the second problem – problem of bad science. The lack of proper scientific method among scholars of social sciences is present, thus they often express their own subjective views based on their cultural and religious background, instead of objective evaluation of evidence. Wishing to improve their careers and gain recognition of their peers many scholars choose to ignore every piece of evidence that would stir academic community or question the established theories. Another example of bad science is lack of multidisciplinary approach. The historians almost never consult archaeologists, ethnologist, etymologists, ethnomusicologists, etc. keeping their interest only in written sources, and the later scholars likewise keep their interests firmly buried deep within their respective areas of expertise. This lack of communication leads to number of hypothesis that are accepted as proper theories among academic community but cannot be applied in the field, because the model they propose is not only inaccurate it is thoroughly wrong (and often in direct conflict with the models proposed by the scholars from different sciences). There is of course the ever present cultural and pseudoscientific influence of the powerful western academic communities that often results in Slavic scholars tuning their papers to be in accord with those theories that are established in the West, though a plenty of evidence exists to show them wrong. Sad fact is that more Slavic scholars dwell on Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Abrahamic and other religions instead on the religion of their own people.
At first the two squirrels were as diagrammatic and identical as the rows of dancing mice in a Fleischer brothers cartoon, just ovals heads seen in profile, their necks thrusting out of perfectly circular holes. Tops (on top) had two long hairs, and Button had buckteeth, but otherwise they were twins. The early gags were corny and inoffensive, the better to work their way into a Birmingham paper. Eventually, though, the jokes took on a psychological and philosophical nature, and as Tops and Button found their voices, they also found their look, and gained individual personality and style. The work took on a life of its own.

For me, there is nothing like hand washing dishes. It is a homemaker's task that hasn't changed in many a long year. What I do is what my grandma did, and her grandma before her. It's so simple and gentle on the dishes, it's relaxing, quiet and satisfying. Just me and a sink of hot water with either liquid soap or dish detergent, a dishcloth, dish mop, stainless steel scourer and brushes, and a sink of warm water for rinsing. I don't dry, I set the plates and cups on the drainer and let them air dry. Hanno wanders along later and puts everything neatly back in its place.
Most people save cleaning and organizing for Spring and Fall, but what about the dead of Winter? With the calendar New Year around the corner, lots of folks are taking time to clean out their lives - getting rid of the things they don't need/want and making room to welcome in the new (possibly better) things. Some refer to this as Resolutions, but even without a name, this is a good time to review your life as is and decide if you'd like to continue the same path or make changes.

The first 6 issues of The Dungeoneer from back in the day each had a featured dungeon. Each of these were great examples of Judges Guild’s wild and wooly take on Dungeons and Dragons. For one thing, the entries for rooms and areas were just like I did mine in my game notebooks, specifically, poor spelling, grammer, and amusing misuse of words. A lot of the time, you could barely grasp what the author (usually the great Paul Jaquays) was getting at in some of the entries, just like one of my players might find my notebook jots to be if they snuck a glimpse. This stuff was so very amateurish, and for sure that was a good thing. It was one of the charms of the stuff; it was written the way I wrote for my games, and how could that not appeal to me? It was homey and warm, and you automatically felt like the author was your buddy, a regular guy in a way Sir Gary never could came off in his flowery prose.

Third, I take issue with the parents claim here that they love their child, and only took action here for financial reasons. You can't say you would have killed her on one hand, then profess love for her on the other. It's morally repugnant and an insult to her as a basic human being. Fortunately for their daughter, she will probably never be fully able to comprehend the fact that her parents wish they could have aborted her.

“It is the business of the International Working Men's Association to combine and generalise the spontaneous movements of the working classes, but not to dictate or impose any doctrinary system whatever.

However, when asked whether Thaci (named 26 times in the report) was being investigated, Eulex officials immediately backtracked by saying that no “formal” investigation had been opened. These confused statements were used by Thaci to pronounce himself innocent and to decry the fecklessness of the EU mission: with sublime, if perhaps unintended, irony he repeatedly resisted proposals to transfer the investigation from Eulex to an ad hoc international body.
This is my girls’ bedroom. We were provided with a bunk bed from my husband’s office as the room is quite small for two beds. It works great. My younger daughter, who is two, used to sleep in her crib up till the end of this past June and now sleeps on the lower level of the bunk bed. She fell off the bed once and landed on the marble floor. Now I tuck in the blanket under the mattress and she hasn’t fallen off the bed since then.
As part of my youngest son's homework for World Book Day, he had to make a model of a fairytale adventure. He made up his own. It consisted of a castle in a shoebox made from card and toilet rolls and a lot of orange crepe paper where it was burning down. He then came and asked me for a dragon to put in it.

"It should be sufficient to say I am Juan Pablo Castel, the painter who killed Maria Iribarne", an opening sentence that provides us with perhaps the only certainty in this novel and a clear indication that what will follow is a confessional. Holed up in prison after his trial Castel determines to set it all down so that we (and that includes him) might understand why he killed. But this isn't really a novel about motivation or the application of logic (though god knows he tries), as we follow our narrator on a tour of the art scene in Buenos Aires and his pursuit of the one woman he feels may understand him we also go on a journey into the dark recesses of his mind, a place where anger, jealousy, intolerance and loneliness combine to leave him with no choice other than to destroy his one hope of salvation.
Case in point was at my last job where two times a month I had to work Saturday and Sunday, which often conflicted with my weekend National Guard duties. This was a manufacturing plant and my associates loved mouthing off about the evil bad guys and how super-duper great our glorious troops were at blowing them up. Their support of the troops last only as long as they did not have to cover my weekend shift. See my service to the country at a time of war disturbed their hunting and fishing time and they resented the Hell out of it.
How much does your life weigh? Imagine for a second that you’re carrying a backpack. I want you to pack it with all the stuff that you have in your life… you start with the little things. The shelves, the drawers, the knickknacks, then you start adding larger stuff. Clothes, tabletop appliances, lamps, your TV… the backpack should be getting pretty heavy now. You go bigger. Your couch, your car, your home… I want you to stuff it all into that backpack. Now I want you to fill it with people. Start with casual acquaintances, friends of friends, folks around the office… and then you move into the people you trust with your most intimate secrets. Your brothers, your sisters, your children, your parents and finally your husband, your wife, your boyfriend, your girlfriend. You get them into that backpack, feel the weight of that bag. Make no mistake your relationships are the heaviest components in your life. All those negotiations and arguments and secrets, the compromises. The slower we move the faster we die. Make no mistake, moving is living. Some animals were meant to carry each other to live symbiotically over a lifetime. Star crossed lovers, monogamous swans. We are not swans. We are sharks.

The problem I have with these presenters, is that they do this all the time, -- with every episode! In every single episode the Whiteman’s reputation, culture and heritage is thrashed to hell. How many viewers are getting the general impression that the Whiteman (Dutch, English or Norwegian), where the scum of the earth? Surely they must realise that many schools in this country will be using this programme for educational purposes! In the end this programme, and many others like it, will cause more harm than good by generating more feelings of racial tension and ultimate hatred towards the ever-dwindling White Race living on the southern tip of Africa.
I remember the first time I ever heard the phrase “work-life balance.” It was 1995 and I was standing in the company cafeteria listening to our group VP tell a story to illustrate how he was trying to model the behavior. Before leaving on his most-recent vacation with his family, he told his staff that he would not be checking e-mail or phone messages and generally would not be available for work-related issues. The VP paused for effect at the end of his story, I guess to impress upon all of us what a radical departure this was for him and his staff. My co-workers and I exchanged puzzled looks. We couldn’t imagine making ourselves available to discuss work issues during our time off.

My understanding of the value of mobiles is that they help babies develop their motor skills as well as their sight. As Hudson is now three and a half months old, it was time to move on from the blue seahorse mobile and the blue felted mobile, to a mobile with brighter colours.

The crass plug first. I was lucky enough to be asked to contribute some reviews to the book Endless Trip, an American/Canadian companion volume to Galactic Ramble. But even if that weren't the case I would still highly recommend it. A fantastic collection of reviews, both new and vintage, of 60s & 70s era pop, psych, folk, prog, rock, r&b, & even some jazz.

Hofstadter’s point is that Americans like to praise common sense rather than reflection and intellect. Although, he wrote in the 60s a look at today’s political discourse can confirm this. Combine Hofstadter’s perspective with that of Carl Marx and the reason the modern university is turning into a worker drone factory is because the capitalistic nature of society requires that it be stocked with young bodies born to be worker bees. Thinking this way, the occupy wall street movement and the student backlash against unemployement, is really a frustration that the almighty system has no place for your type of worker bee. When in reality it has no place for you because it has no place for thought anymore.

It has made our nation fling toward the poor house. My wife and I gave up our home and 4 acres. I weep for my country. I say the pledge with tears in my eyes. Time is standing still due to the thought that they still have time, 7 days a week to ‘good ole boy’ spending into oblivion.

In a perfect V formation, I saw 5 seagulls approaching the circling mass. Not only was their formation perfectly in line, but the distance they kept between each other, and the fact that they were identical clones of one another! Have you seen seagulls? There are white, white with black, brown, beige, and multi-colored variances of these colors. But these were the whitest white, with the blackest black tips on their wings.
Sierra Nevada Celebration 2009
Fortunately, her inspiration and dedication resulted in the now iconic I am Woman. She recorded an initial version of the song for her first album but wasn’t satisfied with it. When producer Mike Frankovich asked to use the song I am Woman in his film Stand Up and Be Counted, Reddy took the opportunity to add another verse, tighten up the lyrics, and re-record the song. She gave Frankovich the license to use the song in exchange for him donating money to Women’s Centers in LA, New York, and Chicago. The new version was a major hit, going to #1 in December 1972 (her first of three chart-toppers). When the United Nations declared that 1975 was “The Year of the Woman” they chose I am Woman as its theme.

I think the biggest change in me this year is that I no longer really care what people think about the fact that I homeschool. Initially, I felt the need to explain why we were homeschooling. I felt like I had to convince people that it is a good option and in Casia's best interest. Now, frankly, I don't give a damn. I'm tired of explaining myself, only to find that people that are against the idea, still think I'm making a mistake. I'm tired of being asked how Casia's going to get the 'appropriate socialization' or how am I qualified to teach her what she needs to learn and how do I even know what she needs?
"At the core of Foucault's picture of modern “disciplinary” society are three primary techniques of control: hierarchical observation, normalizing judgment, and the examination. To a great extent, control over people (power) can be achieved merely by observing them. So, for example, the tiered rows of seats in a stadium not only makes it easy for spectators to see but also for guards or security cameras to scan the audience. A perfect system of observation would allow one “guard” to see everything (a situation approximated, as we shall see, in Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon). But since this is not usually possible, there is a need for “relays” of observers, hierarchically ordered, through whom observed data passes from lower to higher levels."

The closing, long story short, follows a legal dispute among heirs with various interests in the building at 27 Prince, which includes apartments and the two sides of Ray’s: the pizzeria and an Italian restaurant, each with its separate entrance, but sharing a kitchen and the corporation name, Ray’s of Prince Street. When the Ray in Ray’s, one of the owners of the building, died in 2008, a row arose over whether the restaurant’s lease was valid and whether it should pay rent. A lawsuit was filed in 2009 and settled this year.

Over the decades, relationships formed at the Emerson branch that would change lives forever.
Some context might be needed here. When the big break began, I found myself unable to concentrate on my work. I thought it was probably temporary and subsequently spent two years not being able to focus. I could produce a semblance of work, so my lack of focus wasn’t noticeable, but I could feel it. And the further I got into graduate studies, the more I found myself unable to focus on my tasks. Professors who read my prose could tell that I had good ideas but wasn’t able to express them. Since writing had always been somewhat natural to me (in fact, the only activity that gave me any modicum of self-esteem), this was especially difficult. Plus, I was in the English field, where writing is a necessary skill.
Former Italian President Francesco Cossiga admitted in the Italian paper Corriere della Sera in 2008, that in the 1970s, the Italian government allowed Arab terrorist groups freedom of movement in the country in exchange for immunity from attacks.
I’ve always struggled with my weight; I’ve never had an actual problem with it. I think it was my mom’s fault. (Sorry Mom!) She had my sister and then me, one after another, as soon as she got married, and then never got back down to her pre-baby weight. No wait–she had body issues even before she was married. But becoming overweight, and then obese, sure didn’t help her issues. I grew up hearing how fat she was. Somehow–I don’t know. Maybe I can’t translate this to Mom’s issues. Maybe I was just born with the same issues she was born with.

On the train ride back, we discovered that Japanese trains have heated seats. It was pretty amazing – a little too amazing, though, because Jason couldn’t keep his eyes open on the way home! We made it back to the station closest to Zach and Miyako’s house and took a nice, brisk, 15-minute walk in the unseasonably cold weather back to the apartment. It was a beautiful, albeit cold, night. And, as we walked the sporadically lit streets and alleyways that would have proved sketchy and unsafe in America, it was as if we were walking in the daytime. I felt no sense of danger or threat that would have normally been present in a similar situation in the states.
4. Romeo And Juliet / How Insensitive (Insensatez)
However, I'm don't want to get into the manipulation and sickening use of the attack for political purposes; instead I think it's important to remember that there were nearly 3,000 people that were killed, and that those people were innocently murdered for the sake of a radical religio-political ideology whose aim it was to strike fear into our hearts, and disrupt our way of living. The people who were killed were fathers and mother, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, friends. Many thousands of people that were nowhere near the World Trade Center, The Pentagon, or the field outside of Shanksville, PA, were affected by losing someone they loved. The ability to deal with and move on from this tragedy has been different for everyone, and some people grieve best by getting revenge. Some people grieve by withdrawing, and closing themselves off to the outside world until they've had time to figure things out for themselves. Some people go on with their lives as if nothing has changed, constantly trying to not remember the horrific events they've witnessed, or the loved ones they've lost. Others simply weep at the unimaginable destruction that was wrought, both to the planes and the buildings that were crashed into, but also in the hearts of people who cannot comprehend what would compel someone to do something so awful to others. The truth is that there is no comprehension of how people can come up with, plan and execute such a ghastly endeavor; but I guess our goal should not be to comprehend, but to feel sympathy not only for ourselves, but also for those that harbor so much hatred and anger within themselves.
One other note: the author is a TV executive. Suddenly it makes sense to me why nearly everything on TV sucks. Sure, there’s Breaking Bad, Sons of Anarchy, Mad Men, Game of Thrones, Community, etc. But for every good show there are like ten reality shows, and I would rather watch a video of myself getting shot in the leg than a reality show.

Square foot gardening uses only 20% of the land space of a conventional garden and saves both water and time. There is no tilling of the soil so anybody can do it. Join JoAnn as she explains the concept of this successful technique.
My face ached from my wide eyes. My jaw drooped so low I could feel the muscles stretch in my temples. Other than that, I didn’t feel much of anything.

This fortnight the challenge at Gothic Arches is to use a photograph or a digital image on our arch. I searched through scanned family photos to find this one of my mother and her sister (second left and centre) sitting out overnight in Hyde Park to get a good spot to watch the next day’s Coronation procession.
Okay, you say. What does all this stuff about ant bites have to do with Mark 14:38 and guarding our minds? Well, as I see it—God has used the ants to show us something. I didn’t put my feet under my desk expecting to have ants bite me. That has never happened to me before—and why should it? If I had known ants were under there, I wouldn’t have willingly offered my feet for them to bite. By the same token—we don’t always see temptation coming. Even when it does show itself, we don’t always take it seriously. We can sometimes just brush it off and keep going along. Temptation will keep ‘picking at you’. When I say temptation, I’m not just talking about the obvious kinds of temptation. I am also referring to the subtle situations that come up when we are fighting discouragement. Those little things that prick your mind and get you thinking in the wrong direction.

But, wait, it can get worse. States like Georgia tax all income from Georgia based employers, whether an employee steps foot in the state or not. Say you worked out of your home in Florida (hooray, no state income tax!) fulltime for your Georgia employer. You would be required to pay Georgia tax.

You make a fairly stiff mixture then put it in the fridge for a while. The recipe said 3 hours or overnight. That was going to be difficult as I had not planned for advance preparation of the mixture. But then some other recipes on the internet said chill for only 15 minutes, so I chilled it for about 1½ hours.
It's interesting, the range of emotion that comes to that non-remarkable street corner across from the Kensington abortion clinic. The ones who come to pray bring one set - and the world that drives by - or uses that clinic brings another set.

Methinks, though, we are seeing more than a little spin here. Go back to May last year and we see "record" audience figures of 7.03 million listeners for the first three months of 2011. Interestingly, back then, a Radio 4 spokeswoman attributed the rise in its audience to the big, breaking news that dominated the year's start, including the Japanese tsunami and the "Arab spring".
Our restaurant expenses seemed surprisingly low to me. I feel like we do spend a lot of time eating out or getting take-out b/c we are so busy. So I guess I was expecting the worst in this category. We are buying for five (well four, Charlotte doesn't consume quite what the rest of us do) so a dinner out never costs us less than $50 even though we try hard to keep the cost down (no appetizer, have the girls share a dinner if we know the portion will be large, no alcohol, etc.). Again, I feel like this total can be lower and planning our weekly meals will help us accomplish this. No more, "Crap! What the hell am I going to make tonight? We need to leave for karate in an hour!". So even if we trim this figure by $50, I'll be excited and call it a success.

After a fantastic effort at the end of the Easter break, it looks like the invitations to our First Class Degree Show in London are ready to start being sent out. After cutting the backing cards, I had considered the carrying out of 300 item-strong repetitive tasks to be something of a forte.Yet I was proved wrong when I laid eyes on the deceptively small box in which our actual invitations arrived in.

Jesus is the truth so when we put on the belt of truth we are surrounding our whole self with Him. Not only in honesty but also the Holy Spirit who protects us and guides us into all truth. The Belt of Truth lets us know what to do next.
This, of course, is antithetical to not just the constitution, but very much to the spirit in which the founders wrote the constitution: the President, acting as commander in cheif, was structurally prevented from falling under the sway of any war’s rush—Congress was given the power to declare war because it was a messy institution with divergent voices, because war is too massive a decision to put it in one—any one—person’s hands. Post-Vietnam, Congress moved to present future presidents from being so able to pursure military actions (given how de-fanged Congress’d been made by that fiasco), yet as of Reagan, such Congressional strictures were getting mercilessly end-runned.

The one-armed man in Twin Peaks was originally written in as a throwaway nod to The Fugitive, but when Lynch realized what a great actor Al Strobel was, he enlarged the role greatly and made it (somehow) central to the series’ mythology.
A Military Demarcation Line within the 4-km wide Demilitarized Zone has separated North from South Korea since 1953. There are periodic incidents with North Korea in the Yellow Sea over the Northern Limit Line, which South Korea claims as a maritime boundary. During my one year in Korea, North Korea attacked South Korea in minor attacks twice. South Korea and Japan claim Liancourt Rocks (Dok-do/Take-shima), occupied by South Korea since 1954.

Recently some old friends of mine got together and started a new bird rescue center in the Morgantown area. Jesse Fallon, an experienced avian veterinarian and his wife Katie Fallon, author of Cerulean Blues, A Personal Search for a Vanishing Songbird (http://ceruleanblues.wordpress.com/) founded the Avian Conservation Center of Appalachia. With an immense amount of support from other volunteers and professionals, the ACCA has a bright future. At one of the first organizational meetings, when each person introduced themselves, most people added the qualifying line “…and I like birds!”. The organization is focusing on rehabilitation, education and research in the form of citizen science.
I’ve written about this topic before. But in the light of the recent take-over bid of the last form of free news (the Internet), I feel it is imperative to repost these critical news items. Most Americans are completely unaware of this new law and are completely unaware of the complete tyranny within them. This new law, called the National Defense Authorization Act 2012 , is so treacherous that Democratic leaders such as Carl Levin (Chairman of the Armed Services Committee) were stunned and outraged by it. The Act is so treacherous that the ACLU, normally Obama’s greatest ally, said, “President Obama’s action today is a blight on his legacy because he will forever be known as the president who signed indefinite detention without charge or trial into law.”

Following on from here and here. Sorry for dragging it out. It's not that I wan't to create a thrilling trilogy and make you fork out three visits to my blog. Just that I have such limited blogging opportunities these days. Plus this week has seen me thinking "why the fuck am I living in Belgium?" more often than I have previously... But I would like now to finish the story.
2 columns aren’t useful, just as they aren’t aesthetic. The actual time “line” is stupid, and glitchy. It would have been cool if they kept it the way it was and simply gave you the ability to look at a person’s every status update in the easier fashion that timeline provides.

I was able to attend the Empowered to Connect Conference here this fall and it was fantastic. An event that ALL parents should be required to attend. I learned so much and I am praying that God will help me remember it when we are in the thick of the difficult times. Education is one of the MOST important things you can do as the adoptive parent. And this conference is well worth the time and energy it takes.
The same thing happened to me once while listening to a young orphan in China play his small violin for a group of visitors. We had just heard the story of how he lost his parents and came to live in the orphanage. He sat silently during the story, one tear sliding slowly down his cheek. Then he quietly picked up his instrument and soothed himself with it. He looked at me, and without warning, a flood of tears rushed down my face. It might sound ridiculous, but I felt as if I could literally feel his pain.

It seemed so foolish to surrender to a nagging feeling.

I did not say that Rock in the OT does not refer to God, which is what your OT Quotes show. I agree with you and the OT, that in the OT Rock is one of the names of God. While the OT uses Rock to refer to God there is nowhere in Scripture that demands that Rock can ONLY & ALWAYS refer to God. You are interpreting these passages as demands but they don’t say that explicitly. In fact in the New Testament Jesus changes Simon’s name to ROCK.

Several years ago, I used to write a paragraph about each child. It took so long to look at all of their assessments, then try to word a sweet, but direct, synopsis 18 different times. I decided there must be a quicker way. So, I created a checklist-style conference form. The skills closely relate to our lengthy report card. All of the "positives" are listed on one side and the "let's work on these" skills are listed on the other. Sometimes, I will put a checkmark on both sides (ex. If a child can count by 1s and 5s but not 10s, I will just circle the 1s and 5s on the "positive side" and then circle the 10s on the "negative side." ) I feel like it's a quick way for parents to see areas of praise and areas of concern.

But I'm also kind of jealous of her. Let me be really frank. There are times when I'm MADLY jealous of her, for this woman has great-grandchildren, and she's basically done living her life for others, and now just lives it for what she enjoys. I love watching her sense of freedom and the lack of "I have to go pick up my kids right now" and "Oh shoot, I have to help my children with their homework or they'll fail." Of course she is a dedicated mother, as I missed her in yoga when she went to help her daughter while her son in law recovered from a heart attack. But she truly doesn't live on the whim of others. She goes where she wants to go and does what she wants to do.
Oftentimes, characteristics as such are overlooked by material-based and shallow individuals that cannot see past the acronyms and newest updates on Facebook. Time is not taken to pause for a moment, and such gorgeous qualities are overlooked.
Oh dear me. She started wailing, screaming, and then crying. I lay beside her as she kicked about. Then I hugged her. She protested and pushed away. I persisted. Hugging firmly but letting her go if she wanted. Then when I knew holding her up would not quieten her as it normally does, I picked her up and sat back against a couple of pillows. She sat on my lap sideways. And she cried.

When I went looking for a picture of me and Dear Hubby for an anniversary themed page, I realized something. We do not have our picture taken together enough. Obviously, I can't take it if I am in it. Well, I guess I could do some self timer shots but I feel too goofy to do that, so I end up relying on when my kids are around and can take a picture for me. My oldest is actually pretty talented and I am really hoping she gets into a photography class next year at school. Anyway, I think I have scrapbooked this picture of the two of us before, but whatever. I really like it and I gave it a new story, so it is like new to me!

“Early in life, individuals develop an internalized view of themselves as adequate or inadequate within the world,” she said. “Children who are continually criticized, severely punished, neglected, abandoned, or in other ways abused or mistreated get the message that they do not ‘fit’ in the world — that they are inadequate, inferior or unworthy.”

Growing up, I was never the "skinny girl." I was always athletic to a degree, and liked being active, but I could see that I was just a little bigger than those around me. My body image wasn't great, and I compared myself to my friends all the time. In college, there was more of the same. Going to a strict Christian college for the first two years meant I didn't gain the Freshman 15, and I stayed active throughout. A transfer, another school, and more of the same.
Unfortunately this country seems to have forgotten the meaning of Memorial Day. It seems the purpose has been lost, and many Americans think it is a day to remember all of our dead, not just those lost in war. Or, even worse, it is just the official start of summer and the first day of barbeque season. Our reverence for those who have fallen in service to their country has dimmed over the decades, starting with our nearly forgotten Korean conflict. Observances really started to wane during the Vietnam war era, when it was much easier for radicals to blame drafted soldiers for the violence than the democratic leadership that ramped up operations in the first place. In fact, the day had so lost its meaning that Congress passed the "National Moment of Remembrance" resolution in 2000, which calls for all Americans to offer a moment of silence at 3pm on Memorial Day to honor our war dead.

All in all Stop Me Before I Kill! is an enjoyable enough early piece of non-horrror entertainment from Hammer Films. Director Val Guest generally keeps this from getting too dull but the production does dabble far too much into then-fashionable psycho babble. One of the bigger issues is that for the most part until the end there is no real threat yet this production still has enough in its favour to make it worth a watch.

I was about 13 when I became really interested in religion because it all struck me as untrue. I read a lot about world religions, I wanted to see if anything struck me as true because the bible never had. Eventually, I decided I was agnostic, until 9/11 at which point I sort of dropped the whole interest in organized religion.
Memoir
Wes Anderson is the kind of director that draws a lot of talent to any project, even when he travels to the other side of the world. This film has many of his regular stars. Bill Murray makes a small cameo in the beginning, this was his fourth collaboration with Anderson. Anjelica Huston in her third film with Anderson as the mother of the three brothers. As the brothers he has Owen Wilson, who has worked with Anderson on all of his films. Jason Schwartzman plays the youngest brother, he also frequently works with Anderson. I am a big Jason Schwartzman fan, he is a really talented and funny entertainer. Adrien Brody plays the middle brother and I am a big fan of his as well. I didn’t like Brody at first but he has continued to impress me with his range as an actor, he just keeps making good movies. What really makes Wes Anderson movies great is the fact that they get better each time you see them. He is a true filmmaker, being involved in all aspects of production. It’s the movies that are made by men like Anderson that tend to be my favorites. In many ways he is very similar to the Coen brothers that way.

There is real support for 'reading for pleasure' as an idea, as something which enables young people to make advances in ways that perhaps they haven't before. The support comes from the NUT with its excellent 'Reading for Pleasure' materials, Booktrust, the National Literacy Trust, the Reading Agency, the Campaign for the Book, the many people who signed the 'Just Read' petition, the Evening Standard's reading campaign and so on.
They recognize God’s great work in creation, for choosing Abraham and making him a great nation, God’s fulfillment of the promise to give Israel land, God’s rescue of the people of Israel from the land of Egypt where God made a name for himself amongst all peoples, for God’s provision for Israel in the wilderness and the giving of the Law, although their fathers had acted stubbornly God still had mercy on them and forgave them, even forgiving them of the calf false idol they made, God gave them manna to eat, water to drink, and clothes to wear, he handed kingdoms and lands over to them, and yet they rebelled again, but God forgave them again and again. God was justified in handing them over to be captured, but now they needed to beseech the mercies of God once again.

I think it would make an interesting spoof to do a movie set in the 1800's and apply modern day laws and conditions. I would love to see Tom Selleck do a movie where he would play a rancher.

I could go on and on, but I will stop. I am sure it is time for news fast, and to feel better, and to get my hands in the dirt. But, as much as I would like all of that to make it better, I am feeling like the world does not have any green grass right now. I know, I know, "The grass is greener where you water it." I guess that is where my tears of frustration might help, but I don't think grass thrives on salt water.

She checked on everything and then told me that if by Friday nothing had changed that we would try a homeopathic remedy and see if that got things going. She told me there is a reason this is happening and to soak up all the relaxing I could. After my nap, I completely agreed.

Art or Idiocy? asked artLedge to create a TOP TEN list. In their own words:artLedge is an experimental platform committed to presenting projects created specifically for the unique parameters of the Ledge and beyond. Exhibitions are celebrated with a festive one-night social nexus for artistic contemplation. Originating from the top of a spiral staircase that connects two floors of an apartment at 1638 N. Western, the artLedge initiative lends itself to an endless number of exhibition possibilities. artLedge’s newest project, transcengressdension, opened Friday at 40000, one of the spaces in the WestTown Gallery Network. Clever as ever, artLedge came up with a list of the top ten top ten lists. So check back here everyday, as a new number (and new list) will be unveiled.
The ego doesn’t realize that the hatred is a projection of the universal pain that you feel inside. The ego believes that this person is causing the pain. It doesn’t realize that the pain is the universal feeling of not being connected with the deeper level of your being – not being at one with yourself.The object of love is interchangeable, as interchangeable as the object of egoic wanting. Some people go through many relationships. They fall in love and out of love many times. They love a person for a while until it doesn’t work anymore, because no person can permanently cover up that pain.Only surrender can give you what you were looking for in the object of your love.

I think it's safe to say that I've never taken my boobs out at work before. So today was a first on several fronts – first day back after my leave, first time exposing my ta-tas in an office setting. It was more than surreal sitting there in the tiny server room, computer fans humming over the sound of my pump, as I whipped up my shirt and stuck the suction cups on.
After a few months, I knew this was light years ahead of any other relationship I'd had in the past. I had been in love before but never like this. After four months of dating, we took our first vacation together. (Belize!) After only six months of dating, we got an apartment together. After a year and a half of dating, we got engaged. And we were married just days before the two-year anniversary of our first date.
Last Friday, Trisha, Emily and I ate out at Big Mamou-great Cajun food! Em is a rather shy young woman who giggles easily, while Trisha and I are old hands at hanging out, telling stories and laughing over a good meal and a drink. It rained when we arrived, then the sun blasted out. We giggled a lot and had a great time. I like nothing more than enjoying a good meal and drinks with good friends!
Luckily, North Dakota failed to meet with a sound understanding of several sciences, such as chemistry, anatomy, physiology, pathology, kinesiology, and sometimes nutrition. You can choose more active in the north dakota hospital a provider of quality programs in massage therapy, and this is real entertainment. You do not take time to get out, meet some new people, make friend and increase your potential, and establish a new mortgage loan. This means that a bankruptcy will prevent you from getting approved for a Victorian touch to your nuptials. Special packages for romance or other occasions can be found in small vocational and technical schools in North Dakota. This place has wonderful gardens that are accredited. Accreditation means that a person could theoretically have never been outside of the accredited massage therapy focus on overall wellbeing of the north dakota hospital and lower payments. By reducing the north dakota hospital for your small business? Then this site will be supremely qualified to assume a position as a massage therapy studios.

Both Obama and Iraqi President Nuri al-Maliki conferenced via video and both are comfortable with this decision to move forward and the execution of doing so. Along with the plan of withdrawing soldiers from Iraq they will also not be sending more soldiers in. Some Georgia-based soldiers have announced that their division will not be deployed in December as scheduled. This to me is huge because my brother is in the army and hopefully he will stay in the United States for a long time now out of harm’s way. Though, I’m not 100% sure whether or not he will be deployed because he originally spent a year in Afghanistan not Iraq. The hope is still there though because they have already removed 100,000 troops from Iraq over the years and violence has remained relatively low. Hopefully this war will be over soon, but the fight against terrorism will always be there but maybe our approach will be a little more peaceful and less deaths will occur.
This is not always an easy task. At-risk youth’s families are often homeless or live in shelters; not exactly an environment in which a youngster can thrive. Under the current economic circumstances, even families who once enjoyed proper living conditions sometimes have to use their cars to provide their children a roof over their heads.

I was totally oblivious to what was about to become “the-day-o-fish.” You see, I probably brought 1/2 a cup of cod to work, heated it up to make fish tacos, and quickly ate them. It wasn’t until I ate my last bite that one of my co-workers started sniffing around and came by the cube my friend and I were sitting in. She pointed at me….”Is that you!?”

Oh and do you know the story behind the “super fast, super healing, super glue”? Be sure to watch Crows Zero first. Funny thing here is that Tokio, on a brink of a moment, even thought of using said glue when he was hit in the head by Housen. I was secretly hoping the Mikami brothers saw that but they were fighting on the other side. Makes me wonder now, which film is funnier. Even though more dramatic and more action-packed, Crows Zero II has lots of funny scenes too.

I have recently run a series on here, Foundation Paper Piecing For The Terrified, where I covered a lot of the basics of how I prepare both patterns and fabric for foundation paper piecing. I always print out a copy of the template for each block I want to make, plus a copy for a cutting guide and a copy to see what I'm working towards. In order to get the full circle I needed 4 copies for the base, however because of how the centre of the block works, I had to dig out my trusty light box and trace the pattern through to get 2 in reverse. Here's my bases ready to go - please note that unlike in my regular blocks, I left the seam allowance on to make sure I got the curves correct:
And I will leave it at that. I think it makes the case for non-representational art better than most essays I've read on the subject.

Finally, I was not sure if I got mad about my situation, I have already been able to yell with my real voice, it was full of rage when I screamed “AAAAHHHHH!”, then I got the chance to get up for seconds, and laid back again. Even though I was relieved and I sighed heavily, I stared in my ceiling for a long time, one of my cousins was there and asked me why I yelled. I said I had an ugly dream, f*ck. It was my first time to scream my whole life out. I was scared I have to admit, it was life and death for me. I find this dream more horrible now compared to my previous nightmares I have had since I was a child, like I felt my soul had partially lifted out from my body. It still gives me goosebumps while I am trying to reminisce it now.
I was super excited about his birthday party this year since he can actually enjoy it. One of his favorite songs is "Old MacDonald" and he sings "E I E I O" often so I figured a farm theme was perfect (I actually created using a straw wreath wrapped in bandana material with "E I E I O" on it to welcome guests). There were SO many fun ideas to go along with the theme which is another reason I had so much fun planning. I reused a lot of stuff I had accumulating/stashed around the house and bought most of the other stuff at Hobby Lobby on sale.
Just a good old deploy and scrum in the centre. I deployed some archers on a flank and my girlfriend bunched up in the middle. There were no heroes since I was just teaching the basics. Armies advanced almost as they deployed for the first turn. My archers started firing from the beginning.

I can't help but get a little weepy looking at this photo. My parents were in their mid-50s when the grandkids started coming. This little guy will never roast hot dogs on the beach with Oma and Opa, or go sailing with them out on Seneca Lake or hike along the railroad tracks with them and pick up treasures. But hopefully he'll still get Opa's stories and Oma's sweet songs, and the certainty that he is well loved.
We were able to look at several properties out in the country while we were there and narrowed our search down to 3 or 4 tracts that look promising. They were wooded areas with some clearing areas where we could build our house. The wildflowers were beautiful, but of course, I forgot my camera!
A beer and a brewery I have been wanting to try for a while, Great Divide's Yeti is a multiple award winning Imperial Stout. Black as the abyss with a dark sticky head. The smell is roasty and a lot hoppier than I had anticipated. The taste is huge and complex like an Imperial Stout should be! Bittersweet chocolate, caramel and toffee, then finally a big, musty, dry, woody finish. It doesn't have that currant flavor that a lot of RISs do. Velvety texture and so drinkable you need to be careful that the Yeti's 9.5% ABV doesn't unleash your untamed side. Superior lacing, as well. Every sip is a little different. The hops are more noticeable as it warms.
Anyway, a few weeks ago in my Illo Majors Studio class we got to create a black and white illustration that would be turned into a rubber stamp. I had a hard time with this at first. I had no idea what I wanted a stamp of! But I rattled my brain and came to the conclusion that I wanted a stamp of one of my characters.

The 'ping ping' of her typewriter is now a distant memory...the collage of her thoughts in her journal have since turned into a collage of life on her blog. She adds the poem to her blog, a sweet memory of young love.
Some of the reforms he brought into play include a standardization for government works and a innovative city development zoning plan.
Furthermore, why the secrecy surrounding the release of his other records? Passport records, school records, and so on? Why has he spent so much money fighting their release? Ridicule if you must, Obama would not pass any background investigation we would perform for a position on any board of directors of a Fortune 100 company in light of what little he has personally provided, along with his refusal to turn over other records related to his past. Yet, he sits in the White House at such a precipitous time in our history. His placement there was no accident, and his election was not some serendipitous event in U.S. history.
I hung up the phone and snuggled under the sheet, looking through the mosquito net that made the orange ambient street light streaming through the window fuzzy.

With Love & Revolution, it’s fair to say that Conte, a guitarist who almost never dominates and a musician that often doesn’t even participate, comes into his own as a composer and conceptualist. It’s a mature work that is more cohesive, satisfying and unique than just about anything Conte has attempted before. A hippy dippy vibe prevails here, as suggested by the retro cover graphics, recalling some of the Impulse work of Dave Mackay and Vicky Hamilton, whose “Here” is heard here. But that’s more a superficial catch-all than what this music is all about.

Riedel is correct in assessing the White House's order as hardball - but a wider list of targets exists outside of Saleh's circle. Meanwhile the financial threat against him and his family remains relatively soft. For starters, the Obama administration still cannot bring itself to speak Saleh's name, demonstrating that its kid gloves have yet to fall off. Contrary to a safety issue, the policy of gradually (and silently) nudging Saleh out of power is linked to hegemonic ambitions. U.S. and EU officials also have floated the possibility of sanctions on various occasions without acting, even though Saleh has persistently obstructed the GCC deal since its release in April 2011.

As an artist myself, I can attest to the fact that is can be difficult to step back and see one's own work objectively. I have made things - paper corsets, mesh dress sculptures, paintings of dresses without bodies but with the suggestion of movement - without really understanding where the ideas came from or what I was trying to say. Often times, my artist statement has come together after the work is completed. I know that many artists work this way, but for this project, since I'm documenting the process as I go, my work is a lot more reflective. I now know that at the root of what I do are two dominant themes - 1. the construction of femininity through fashion and 2. vanitas. For this particular project, the dress I'm making is meant to symbolize Marie Antoinette. The shape - with the exaggerated panniers - embodies the feminine. How I alter the dress to incorporate an element of post-modernist subversion requires more thought....

One of the examples sent to me is that of the little Black Country town, Cradley. It recently had one side of its main High Street demolished for a by-pass. It has made the town look ridiculous and odd. This folly was proposed to the council by unelected planners and, in this case, authorised by just one councilor. I rang Sandwell council several times but none of the planners were ever available and the calls were not returned.

Kept saying “Awesome venue!” on the train at Vauxhall and rubbing his knees against me!!!!! Hoped to avoid him, but he got off at Clapham (platform 4) and walked very close to me all the way to platform 15 (I was varying my speed....) where he said “Oh, aren’t you coming with me to the exit?” I said “Er, no. I am going to CroyDon” and he said “You sure you don’t want to come with me and have fun?”

I was very pleased with the result and look forward to eating this again. In my mind, it is equally as good as the smoked Turkey and Collard greens I had previously made. A bonus for those who don’ like the smell of cooking collard greens, bok choy has none of that strong cabbage smell which is perhaps why it has very little cabbage flavor.

Unfortunately, the reality of the new racially exclusive Africanism of Mbeki and its pervasive acceptance amongst the black elite only dawned on many when he made his two nations speech. Even then the business world and whites choose to ignore it, the economy was doing just swell, and if you were wealthy so were you.
The Live Luminance range have been specially formulated to work on dark hair which is meant to lighten and colour in the 1 step. I have read a few reviews from other people who have coloured dark hair and unfortunately it has had very mixed reports so if you have coloured dark hair i would make sure you do a strand test first. ( Mine was prelightened by my hairdresser ages ago to strip the colour out )
Gillette is something of a geeky character and that pretty much fits my image of a hacker type. Sure that’s stereotyping, but we’re all guilty of that to some degree. I never really got a feel of that reader-character connection to any of the other characters. They seemed more like supporting characters to me.

Momo’s balcony overlooks the pool. Her apartment is WAY too nice for college kids, but that’s all that lives there! What happened to living in a dump during college? Sitting on a sofa you bought at a yard sale with books under one leg to keep you from tipping over? They have hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances, beautiful cabinets, and just look at this pool! It was a warm day today so all the kids were out at the pool. There was volleyball, corn hole, football throwing, more beer cans overflowing trash cans and littering the ground than you’d see at an outdoor concert. There had to be 150 kids out there. It was like a scene from MTV Spring Break. Amazing. How do they study?? Anyway, we had a great day then hit the road for the ride home.
As the skies have grown more congested, so has the incidence of bird strike. Up to 2,000 incidents of birds colliding with aeroplanes have been reported annually in the United States alone; many more are recorded worldwide (indeed, the International Bird Strike Committee was set up some years ago by commercial, military and private aviation bodies to investigate such incidents and find ways of reducing of the frequency and risk of collisions between aircraft and birds).

Growing up together, Casey and Pascal were the best of friends. He was a thoughtful, shy boy. He was totally in love with Casey. Nevertheless, his puppy love for her went unnoticed. He was a cute boy, soft-spoken and kind. Although he spent a lot of time hinting, to let her know how he felt about her, his efforts fell on deaf ears and blind eyes. Pascal was always courteous and subservient whenever Casey was concerned. He thought of her as a Southern Belle to the extreme. Still, Casey thought of Pascal as a brother. He was the closest thing she had to a sibling and the thought of him having a crush on her never entered her mind. His soft spot for her wasn’t even a sparkle in Casey’s eye.

“The importance of a much older form of commons in these revolts has earned scant attention—the public spaces where citizens rally to voice their discontent, show their power and ultimately articulate a new vision for their homelands.” –Jay Walljasper

As Alex's World of Food expands with me, we have agreed upon a code of conversation. I want to uphold and honor his food needs, while opening his culinary world; He wants to trust me to feed him without judgment and open his culinary world in a gentle fashion. We now view offers of new foods as "Challenges" - there is no attachment to the outcome of said challenges, I think of it as Strewing Food and this is the term he chose to use. So many examples of his courageous acceptance of challenges this summer! To his rotation he has added: Newman O's (mint and chocolate!!), 2 flavors of Dutch Cheese, Coconut Bliss, stevia sweetened koolaid things, Cheddar Cheese Popcorn, Trader Joe's Goodies ... And Today.... Tortellini! The Magic works something like this:

The Evening Standard stated the following:
He cuts a slightly disheveled swath through the Capitol at all hours, his calling often cited by colleagues as his chief accomplishment after a decade of service here. “Tim had his finger on the pulse of his district,” Speaker John A. Boehner said in an e-mail, “and always reminded members that at the heart of every democracy are representatives who will listen first, learn, and then lead.”I’ve never understood what’s so extraordinary about this phone habit. According to the Times, Johnson calls 4,000 constituents a year. (His district has a population of 700,000.) Skip Thanksgiving and Christmas and the calls average eleven a day. Count only working days (251 in 2012), and the average jumps to sixteen, still not that many calls to make. Johnson has never called me, though he has sent long and thoughtful responses to several letters and e-mails. The one occasion on which I heard him respond to constituents, a 2009 “town-hall meeting” on health care, was deeply dispiriting. I wanted to hang up.
I am not sure what the students will think of my quote handout. I actually found that saying last week after my dear dear friend lost her father. She is strong, brave, and smart. She is amazing. But at a time like that, I just wanted to make sure she remembers that. I think we can all use that reminder when times are tough.
Stay tuned for: My letter to Mark Zuckerberg that MAY OR MAY NOT be doctored to look like it came from the U.S. Government, Mephistopheles Scores an AK-47, Rubber Chicken Puppet Theater (really, WE PROMISE, RIGHT SIRRAH!?!?), and Why I Need a Two Foot Long Rubber Great White Shark.
Combine the egg yolks and 1/2 cup (100 grams) of the sugar in a medium bowl and whisk until the mixture turns a very pale yellow and doubles in volume. (If you own two electric mixer bowls, you can whip the yolks in an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment)
Telugu superstar Ram Charan Teja is all set to make his Bollywood debut with the 2012 version of Zanjeer, opposite one of B-town’s highest paid actresses, Priyanka Chopra. And to peeve the fans of Charan, speculations about PC being paid more than their star was enough. And as expected, rumours are afloat about his Telugu fans being upset and wanting to make it clear that Charan flies high with a 12 crore remuneration, and PC lags behind with a reported 5.5 crore price tag.
Speaking of Poe, he is a major player in another nonfiction book about the case which I read all the way through: The Beautiful Cigar Girl by Daniel Stashower. This is a standard work of historical true crime, made sexier by Poe’s role in the story. It suffers a bit from the basic problem with the Mary Rogers story — we never do find out what, exactly, happened to her and who was responsible — as opposed to other great works of historical true crime, like The Devil in the White City and The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher. Those books give you an answer to what the hell happened. Stashower’s book gave me a lot more insight into Poe, so that was a plus. If you’re interested in this story or in that genre, I recommend it. The subtitle, I must say, is a bit much: “Mary Rogers, Edgar Allan Poe and the Invention of Murder.” I get that you want to get Poe in there. And I get that this case was part of the beginnings of both widespread public interest in crime, via the new popular press. But murder’s been around for a long time, hasn’t it?
When I arrived at the clinic I sat in the waiting room surrounded by certificates and photographs of this man with Prince Charles, in the gardens of Buckingham Palace and receiving awards in the House of Lords- all very impressive I'm sure you would agree.
I look back on Lost Boys 2 and think that we were fucking insane to even attempt to make that movie in 21 days.

You see, I practically grew up backstage of a small theater where my father was gainfully employed as an actor. The props were my first toys, the rehearsals my play dates. I knew from early on that it was all pretend, and yet...
Robert Bro Brown stands in front of the Club Indigo, “windy-city” cold blowing into his bloodshot eyes. How long since he’s closed his eyes - months, maybe even years. He looks up and down the boulevard - not a car in sight. Quiet, except for the sound of a dog howling in the distance.
So she’s turning the car left and I’m flying out of the open car door to the right (starboard). Johnny grabs my left hand and then I look down for one of those eternal moments at the hard black pavement speeding by me just a few feet under the soft tissue of my face.

The biggest challenge in sharing book apps with students is finding high quality apps. In librarian terms, this is collection development or curation. The App Store is terrible; you can easily find the newest and the most popular apps, but it is very difficult to find more than that. I regularly turn to the following sources to read about book apps. All provide thoughtful, high quality reviews:
They’re just slightly older.
I'm pretty sure that if I just cleaned the ring really well, it wouldn't be pink anymore. I can't imagine that the diamond itself has been dyed, just some soap scum or dirt or something on the surface of the diamond has been dyed pink.
We arrived at the Mt Piegan border crossing around 10 AM and made it through the check point with no problem. However, we did notice a lot of cars and RVs lined up to enter Canada. We weren't sure what was causing the hold up - this is not exactly a busy area!

Disregarding any of the higher isolation levels and using the out-of-box read committed isolation level you’d expect an exclusive lock to block a share lock. Here’s a case, admittedly not that common, where blocking does not occur.
All the hoses and the watering cans are out and ready to be put to use. I like a bit of regimentation. The one on the red chair is quite old and came from Steptoes Yard a treasure trove for lovers of old garden implements.
Jake come in with a punch, but Nic wraps him up and pins him against the cage. Some knees now from Nic, but Jake gets him off balance and takes him down to the ground withBelllanding in the top position. He has a mount, but Nic is on his side. Jake’s corner is calling for elbows.
I’m fascinated by Vin’s interactions with Elend particularly because we haven’t seen much of the nobility yet, but he’s already set himself apart as being a bit different from all the rest. It leads to some ethical questions about Kelsier’s plan because the nobility aren’t being presented as pure evil. Vin seemed to have liked him, and if she gets any sort of romantic ideas then it might jeopardize her role in the plan. Right now she doesn’t know the nobility at all, but if she starts getting attached to anyone then she might have second thoughts about what she’s planning on doing.
An idea that makes you sit up and go WOW that’s something a bit different. A killer idea would make me dip straight into the script right there and then even if I have a million other things to do.
How you decide to balance out the flavours is down to experiment. Nevertheless, for my taste, the addition of fresh lemon juice, a little salt, and a good pinch of cayenne pepper transforms a potential ordeal into a genuine pleasure! Actually, what I didn’t do in the video, but would normally do, is add both a small grated carrot and a large ripe tomato to provide a little extra sweetness; on this occasion though I gave my last carrots and the tomato to the pigs for breakfast before filming. Doh!

Let’s go back to the alpine pastures… how very beautiful… those little wooden houses up there, with the little restaurants – and souvenir shops… I can’t tell for sure – we were never allowed in… that’s what we had taken our rucksacks for. Instead of drinking the cold spring water up there we had to carry our water and food up which didn’t ease the pain – at least not mine…

Persecution of Thought Criminals by the Tolerant
However, as a woman who has so far been immune to the apparent charms of black men, one has to ask the question, what's in it for the sizable minority of white women who seem so eager to cross the interracial divide?
Steven is not the only guest to suffer from panic attacks. I do not normally divulge celebrity secrets but as Mr Gervais has been so unkind to me recently I don't mind saying that on his first TV interview with us Ricky actually soiled himself live on air. I believe you can download this on You Tube. If I say so myself we handled the situation very professionally indeed. Being aware of Ricky Gervais' discomfort, Richard directed the camera towards me and working on pure TV instinct I just started to Irish Dance.
I REMEMBER on CAMRA trips many years ago a song being sung with the refrain “The brewery tap’s a supermarket now.” And in recent years that has proved all too prophetic, with a number of pubs in the local area closed and replaced with the likes of Tesco Express. This may be a cause for regret, but in reality it is a symptom of the decline of the pub trade, not a cause.

I'm pretty sure we all have a mat. It might be any wound or doubt or belief or unbelief that keeps us from walking. It might come from our own heart and mind or it might even be something someone else doesn't want us to forget.
So what was the point of this? Presumably to get the "human angle". It's another indication of the relentless tabloidisation of the BBC. Instead of being content to report the news authoritatively, we have to suffer the vacuous follow-up, itself longer than the original item, which reveals precisely nothing about the incident, because the interviewee knows nothing.
Last week, I received a very important phone call from Nancy at CP2 telling me that my Penny Black order had arrived in the shop. WOO HOO! I had been wanting to get my Copic stained hands on these sweet images by Mo Manning for PB, for a very long time. OMG! They are adorable and SO much fun to color! This one is called Sweet Day and I know for a fact that Nancy still has these available in her shop. I love this image because it reminds me of a strawberry dress that my mother made me when I was a wee lass. It had strawberries embroidered all over it and I just LOVED that dress. I think I even have pictures of me wearing it in one of those fancy schmancy Olan Mills photo sittings.

Quite a run if you ask me. Fortunately the movie was a good deal shorter. I watched the film on the basis of a recommendation from a reader who suggested that if I liked Emily Blunt‘s work in The Devil Wears Prada and The Adjustment Bureau, then I should watch The Young Victoria.

The old man blew his nose into his hankie once more. Then, hanging onto a chair, he pulled himself up from the floor. Buttoning his overcoat, he reached for the dog's leash and softly said, "Come here my friend." He opened the door against a gust of cold air and stepped outside, pulling the dog behind. Dusk was beginning to fall. Monsieur DuPree pulled back. He didn't want to go.
Go back to the nineteenth century, and it's a bit harder. There are newspapers and magazines - quite a lot of them - and if you're lucky enough to find databases that have them as word-searchable PDFs, you can fillet all mentions of your chosen subject from tons of last century's chip paper within minutes. The trouble is, you know how now, the mainstream press don't write much about beer? Well, they didn't much then, either. For example, over 99.9% of the 16,000 mentions of 'India Pale Ale' in the Burley Collection of 18th and 19th century newspapers are in the classified ads section, and while the first few you look at are very revealing (that's where I discovered the earliest actual mention of 'India Pale Ale' for example) after that, they're all the same.
And experience, a form of life that we can only earn.
The Groundhog Day festivities on February 2, 1992 were joined by Bill Murray studying for his role in the movie. Then, Columbia Pictures set out to recreate the Punxsutawney Groundhog Day down to the smallest detail. There were, however, many changes made.
We simply can’t have this type of unruly behavior on one of Washington D.C‘s grandest traditions- politicos hobnobbing with and showcasing rich elite celebrities and other people with overly inflated visions of self importance.
The first step of this transformation was to get the bases (I wanted closed storage at the bottom instead of shelves like Emily’s). But we couldn’t do much with those until a big step was done – and that got done today! WHOO!
Right! So, we would want a president who is slim, young, has a good leg, is famous and has well-groomed hair. If it’s a woman, she should know better than to wear those boring sarees. Especially when she’s on a beach. That’s all that matters, yes?
And Jake is a huge tool, but with tie clips, less is more. They exist so you DON’T need to think about your tie. It’s like, tie’s locked down. Thin, silver, locked up. Also, pocket square? If you do, straight line, like Draper would do. No poofy thing or triangle. Straight line. Bourbon. Lazers. Bears. Just in case they make you wear one in the future. I wouldn’t steer you wrong. You wouldn’t steer me wrong with wine either. Good looking out. Glad we did this.
Anyway, last night we played a good five-hour game. Since I played Boomer, I got one Loyalty Card to start, and in the middle of the game, I get automatically sent to the brig as my negative (each character has one negative feature) as well as two more Loyalty Cards (super sketchy, for good reason). Even with the three Loyalty Cards I ultimately had, I was human.
Occupy has also brought the simple right to assemble peaceably into the spotlight. If cops in riot gear think they can bust up nonviolent groups of demonstrators for no good reason, we, the 99%, now have more work to do.

I have UFOs that are well over a year old. Come to think of it, I have one UFO, a lace tablecloth, that is at least 5 years old. I set it aside because the circular needle I was using had a join between the tip and the cable that made it difficult to slide the stitches along. I had to find a needle with a smoother join that was the proper size and had nice, pointy tips, and by the time I had procured the appropriate needle, I had lost interest in working on lace knitted in #60 cotton. This UFO currently resides in the depths of my yarn closet and may remain there for an eternity.

“IUOE union bosses believe one set of rules should apply to them while the workers who are forced to accept their so-called ‘representation’ are essentially told to shut up and stay out of the way,” said Mark Mix, President of the National Right to Work Foundation. “Fortunately, these courageous workers are dedicated to protecting their rights in the face of rank union boss hypocrisy.”
I don’t feel like I’m someone who fears change or is resistant to it, but it still doesn’t come easily. After reading up on this really simple concept, I can see that despite how actively I try to achieve my goals, I still stay where it is comfortable.
Traditional art develops within traditional forms and it develops the forms. In his Christian paintings of the fifties Dali adapted forms to his individual vision but they are recognisably traditional forms. Dali was a genius - contemporary artists are not. They need to shock to get recognition. Real Art grows out of tradition and provides sustenance, spiritual or worldly, for people rather than negative emotions like shock or offence that are harmful.
You might or might not have noticed but I’m somewhat a Grammar Nazi (GN), I shriek at the sight of a misspelling in my posts and I have have to correct it ASAP, but sometimes I have this urge to punch in one or three more ‘!’ than necessary and to insert quite a few of those smiley expressions at one time just to show how much I enjoyed a post, for example: I didn’t just like but I loved loved those photos Daphne had posted of her trip in Malaysia, but the Grammar Nazi in me suppressed the impulse to over do it. Speaking from experience, while on the internet it is much harder to discern someone’s reaction to a post or a comment, oh they’d type it out for you plain and straight alright, but often there’s hardly any emotion, any vibes to be felt at all (unless they make it very clear). Exclamation marks (even a single one) and smiley faces sets this tone to what you’ve said, to me it says: Awesome, good stuff, dude!
Look, for those of you still consumed by indignation, a few points to mull over:
2. The one or two tanda rule: Unless you plan on saying, "sleeping with me is an option," do not dance more than two tandas in a row. Make it one -- even better. Thank each other and get off the floor at the cortina. If you really liked dancing, make it clear that you would like another dance later on. Fellow blogger, Terpsichoral, tells me that in Buenos Aires one clears the floor, and that dancing more than one tanda is rare. Hmm, I wonder why! Buenos Aires is full of Tomcats, she says, but that's okay because the women know how to manage these furry creatures. Exactly my point! I am not out to neuter Tango Tomcats, just help communities neutralize them!
The Princesses of Iowa is the story of Paige - high school senior, rich kid, popular gal, “princess”, shallow, etc. She and her two best friends, Nikki and Lacey, were in a car accident during the spring. A car accident in which all three of them were drunk - Nikki was driving, Lacey was “crippled”, and Paige walked away with nothing more than a few bumps and bruises.
She was talking about how much her family has, and her kids have plenty of toys. And that she wanted to concentrate on being thankful for all they were blessed with, rather than thinking of what else they can get.
Starting in 1996, the movie is about newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) having a meeting with US President, Bill Clinton (Dennis Quaid). They want to join forces to advance a democratic, progressive way a country is run.
Think of your friends and family and all the complexities of their characters. Think of all their nuances and traits. It would be difficult just to sum all of that up into a simple category. Most people fit across several. People will even wander in and out of roles throughout their life. Give your characters the same complexity.

Motorola decided to escalate the conflict going outside the US. Motorola began suing Microsoft internationally. Starting in Mannheim Justice Court in Germany, over the use of wifi patents as well as H.264 video encoding in both Xbox and Windows. This move against Microsoft in Mannheim prompted Microsoft to retrat from Germany. Microsoft moved its headquarters out of the small German town of Duren and into the Netherlands where Microsoft deemed it might be safer. The German courts move far faster then their American counter parts and are known to ban the sales and distribution of technology in a heart beat.

Go back before that, and most of the population were illiterate. Newspapers die out altogether when you reach the seventeenth century. Now it gets trickier. There's the odd diarist whose work has survived, which is why if you read anything historical about the seventeenth century (including my new book) you will unfailingly discover what John Evelyn and Samuel Pepys thought about the subject at hand.
(from their website) ~ Our Speaker is Bob O’Brien who will present his research of the 20th Connecticut Regiment, including details of Soldier George W. Warner who lost both arms in battle. See a photo of the 1865 reunion at Gettysburg for the dedication of the regiment monument on Culp’s Hill. The 20th Connecticut Regiment monument on Culps’ Hill at Gettysburg was dedicated in 1885, 20 years after the close of the Civil War. During the terrible, 3-day battle, the 20th played a critical role by holding Culp’s Hill against a Confederate attack from the rear.

Here in New York, we hated watching real estate and financial services elitists drive up the prices of everything from affordable apartments to martinis in midtown with the reckless speculation that would eventually lead to mass layoffs, rampant joblessness and the wreckage of so many retirement dreams. No one ever asked the rest of us if we minded, it just happened. I’m sure people across the country can tell similar stories.

Last week on my way to work, the entire square was plastered with words of encouragement:
We are privileged to share this good news and are to live our lives as to examples of this grace in all we say and do. In the Old Testament, Aaron and the priests under the law would pour the anointing oil upon their heads; it would run down upon their beards, and onto their garments. They would be adorned with a sweet fragrance, a perfume that came from the anointing on the outside of their bodies. We have been anointed with a holy oil on the inside from Christ Jesus by His Spirit. And this anointing will never wear out, it cannot be washed off, its fragrance is eternal. Unlike the priests in the Old Testament who wore the fragrance on the outside, our High Priest adorns us from the inside, giving us the sweet fragrance of grace as a testament to the world and to God the Father.

They seem to have an intuitive understanding of what's going to work and what's not going to work. They are not deluded by marketing cliches or expert opinions.

Nobody walks a mile in my shoes. I am sure someone looking at me, currently unemployed and overweight, I must be a loser who just sits and eats ice cream all day. They have no idea how much I have struggled with my weight, or how I've been working since I was 12 years old and recently got laid off and could lose my house. So while I understand that Khloe Kardashian is on TV and we see her life that she allows us to see, we don't know any of her struggles, we don't necessarily know what her struggles are that she doesn't share with us or that person that has an affair on their spouse, I'm not saying it's right, but we don't know what has gone on in that relationship prior to it so who am I to judge her.
Writing prompt exercises are fine, but where do those come from? They come from another writer's imagination, that's where. What are you doing to stretch your own imagination? Look around you, pick common things up and examine them in detail. Think about them and ask questions. There are stories in everything, in everyplace, and in everybody. It's up to the writer to make those stories come to life in an interesting way.

There were many more wonderful moments during the conference but this post is already way too long and I don't want to bore all of you anymore. All I can say is that if you haven't gone to an SCBWI annual conference yet, don't miss it. It will be an experience that you'll never forget.

Oh well you know, I'm an old fashioned kind of a guy. And I like the contact. You ladies, you are ladies? You ladies are always so kind.
“Yeah… That would be the one” Jonan confirms.
Problem is that my hubby is on this detail where he goes to bed at 8pm. Which means I have been putting our daughter to bed at 9pm. Which means that she finally goes to sleep at 9:30-10 and by then I’m tired. Did I also mention that she hasnt been napping? Yeah, that too.
If you live in California where you are restricted to 10 round magazines, then maybe you should move. If you live in Illinois, NYC, or DC, then you should definitely move. If you live on Airstrip One (formerly Britain) where essentially only shotguns may be owned then adjust accordingly. If you live in Switzerland you probably already know how to shoot and have excellent equipment. Everyone should know and abide by their local gun laws, no matter how Draconian, illogical, and unconstitutional they may be. These laws are for your protection/sarc.

I've been browsing Flood® Wood Care's website and it is really fun to see the image gallery. Their are so many fun project to look at with beautiful colors, and fun inspiration, I wish I could pick them all. I'm sure many of you are planning diy summer projects as well. If you have any wood projects coming up, I would definitely check out Flood® Wood Care for some ideas on how to treat, maintain, and create your outdoor space. In fact, I would just go there either way and look at all of the neat ideas just because they are amazing to look at and plan for. It's just an awesome company with quality products and hey!, they are the wood care specialist after all. I'll have to keep you all updated on my little stair case and the tender loving care it most definitely needs.

No one read the “Last One Off The Boat Turn Off The Lights” sign that I would have posted on it had I known this would be an issue. So, they didn’t. Or maybe raccoons can’t read, so it wouldn’t have mattered anyway.

As previously stated, knowledge is obtained through familiarity. Therefore become familiar with someone. Become familiar with the knowledge gaining process; “…seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith” (D&C 88:118). Knowledge is gained by opening our mouths to inquire, opening our eyes to new experiences, and then closing our mouths so our ears can hear the knowledge being imparted unto us.
I have misplaced the journal I keep for my son. I've kept a journal for both him and my daughter since they were born - recording milestones and funny stories and their little quirks. I'm not the best journal-keeper - but I have made an effort to write in these journals on their birthdays and whenever they do something that I don't want to forget.

If you are currently in Il wishing to find some quick and momentary financial Loans, it is recommended take an Il cash advance Loan. In other words, this is called a temporary financial Loan, this means credit that’s going to endure right until your next cash advance or maybe the quality is often extended until the subsequent payday. It is otherwise known as typical almost financial Loan once the credit standing is just not thought about. This can be a bonus to those with poor credit who, evidently, are unable to receive credit rating effortlessly or may not be thought to be to borrow by any means.
Nonetheless, I also bought myself, Lori, and Mike Sketchers Tone Up sneakers--I love them! I should buy Sketchers stock. You know what stock I wouldn't buy, though? Facebook. You know about their IPO, right? Don't think I've giving stock advice now, I'm just saying I think Facebook is a little past peak.

So here I sit, stewing in my sin. I’m angry with myself for even thinking that I could fix the things in my life that need fixing, but that only God can truly fix. I’m a sinner in need of forgiveness. Nothing about that has changed since yesterday, but today I’m totally and utterly aware of that fact. You know, saying “I’m a sinner” is easy when you talk about things like being frustrated with a family member, or needing to get control of your tongue, or something like that. But when I sit here, face to face, with a sin that goes to my core, it’s a very stinging, bitter moment. So what can I do? Only one thing – suck it up, and go to GOD, yes, the REAL GOD, the ONE AND ONLY GOD, with a heavy heart, and ask HIM to forgive me.

1 Back Wynd,
Each year my husband and I take turns looking for something fun and new to do for our anniversary. Last year was my turn, and I happily stumbled upon Carefree Adventures operating out of Simmie, SK of all places (yeah, I didn’t know it was there either!).
I think I am finally getting close to being over him, but last night I was hit with the ultimate challenge: he told me he has a new girlfriend. I handled it extremely well and I know he was very relieved because only a couple months earlier I had foolishly let him know that I would be devastated when he got a new girlfriend. I think probably even three weeks ago, before I left on my trip, my reaction would’ve been closer to that, but I learned a lot on my trip.
On the issue of secondary school teachers, I remember having a heated discussion with a senior figure in Africa’s education scene round about the time the World Bank and the Commission of Higher Education had unimaginatively called for increasing the price of higher education in the country. I was then calling for increasing access to university education by adoption of Open Learning systems facilitated by the internet. The gentleman argued that increasing access was not the key issue. In his opinion, the poor quality of students emanating from primary and secondary schools was the crux of the problem and unless this is fixed, increasing the number of graduates leaving Kenyan universities would simply be a case of garbage in, garbage out. While concurring that the gentleman had some strong point to make, I should point out that I do not whole heartedly agree with the assessment with his analysis of secondary school products being of poor quality. The garage is rubbish but the car is a Mercedes. Kenyan students have potential; what is letting them down is the quality of the system and the trainers. What we need to do is fix or change the garage so that the true potential of the car can become self evident.

In four years time I will be half a century old. This just isn't fair, I feel about twenty. All the cardio, weights, boot camps, hiking and running I do can't stop my body wearing out and the fact that my eye lenses are no longer as flexible as they were is the first indication of my inevitable decline.

Hi Readers! So many folks sent in this story today, I present it to you in all its insanity, even though it struck me as a little too bizarre and garbled to be 100% accurate. For instance, the crazy accusations were reported to the press only by one of the accused. Ho ho hmm.

And sometimes I see her like it is the first time. I forgot how gorgeous and miraculous and special she is. Then I catch a glimpse of her with the sun in her eyes, a goofy expression on her face, just being sooo her and I remember. I remember that it is not the messes, the whining, the tantrums, the refusing to nap, the being into everything all day. Those are just actions they are not her. She is so much more, she can make anything tolerable.

They are so mature, so solid. They found themselves an apartment, closed on so many things. Tomorrow they want to go shopping for a bedroom set. I wish I could go with them, but the night before a national conference is impossible for me. I don't have a dress to wear year...none of us have clothes except for Elie. Shmulik will probably wear the suit he wore to his wedding; Davidi might be able to wear the suit he wore last year, but I think he grew too much - though I won't complain.
Right now they don’t.
PS. Just some additional ‘technical’ details for those who may be interested. For people who haven’t danced to places with very good tango (for me Italy from Rome and to the north is the reference in Europe) the level of the dancers and the quality of the ‘circle of dance’ will be more than satisfactory. Some criticism is that many people dance more open embrace, a style not so of my taste, which also makes couples occupy more space, a disadvantage for the crowded hours of the milonga. Also some dancers (among them several high level ones indeed), weren’t so respectful for the rest and moved in a rather ‘chaotic’ way, making co-existence quite difficult. But in general nothing reaches really disturbing levels and the milonga flows all the time…
I have no love for the police. I've made no secret of that. There was a time when my respect for them was unbridled. I genuinely believed we had the best coppers in the world. That stopped some time ago, when I discovered that they were really thugs in uniform, for the most part. I'm not going to tar them all with the same brush because that would be unfair on the good ones. But they are as rare as hens teeth, which is a damned shame.
After fifty years of earning a good living as a public relations counselor and a provider of editorial skills, the market for my skills has contracted in response to the economy. That’s my SOTU. I am confident that, when the economy improves, there will be individuals, corporations, trade associations and others who will rev up their efforts to influence consumers and issues, but until then, while the President lives off the fat of the land, I am pretty much living off my “fat.”

On November 12, 2001, the United States experienced its second deadliest aviation accident in history. It occurred when American Airlines Flight 587 crashed into the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens, New York. The accident took place two months after the September 11 terrorist attacks, and it caused panic in New York. Thousands of people witnessed the Airbus A300 crash to the ground, killing all 260 people on board. Many people reported a fire and explosion before the plane crashed, but the National Transportation Safety Board attributed the disaster to the first officer’s overuse of rudder controls. Al-Qaeda has listed the crash among its successes, but physical evidence was never presented indicating terrorist activity. Surprisingly, the story was widely underreported in the United States, considering the magnitude of the crash. In the months after the tragedy, rumors were circulated that suggested that the plane was exploded by a shoe bomber, similar to the failed attempt of Richard Reid, but these claims are unsubstantiated.
Bay windows are a wonderful addition to any property and fewer and fewer properties are actually being built with any bay windows, making them somewhat of a dying breed! However, if you have a bay window you then you may well realise that despite looking great, owning bay windows does come with its own set of responsibilities. It seems that one of those responsibilities is to pay a premium on bay window curtain poles when compared to normal curtain poles!

Part of this is surely a difference of length, but that doesn’t account for everything. Yes, Tolkien laments the passing of the “Age of Heroes,” and he’s quite negative about the industrial age of his own time. Still, in his books the wizards and elves recognize that their time is passing. They save Middle Earth not for themselves, but for Men, who will go into the future alone. Yeskov’s vision is less complicated, less ambiguous. There are the good guys, and there are the bad guys. The bad guys win, but then they don’t. Yea for the good guys! It’s not really that simple, but it’s not that far from it.
Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the lentils and a pinch of salt and return to a boil. Lower the heat, cover and cook for about 20 minutes until the water is absorbed.

Graceful earrings by Lorraine Schwartz go together the neckline and makes Emma Watson look just perfect.

How do you find a way to share that information efficiently?

It can be frustrating not knowing when we pass, are people being polite or did they assume that I was the woman I was presenting as. Was that odd look because I am not doing something right that is giving me away, did my voice betray me, the way I walk? Endless second guessing.

2. Keep in mind that an expensive, well-constructed shoe made of quality materials is not always guaranteed to be comfortable. A beautiful shoe is a work of art, but a comfortable shoe is a work of architecture, and the two don't always go together. Whenever I'm interested in a brand I haven't worn before, I always make sure to do plenty of research and read the online reviews first. There are plenty of brands out there that offer both style and comfort, so make sure you've done your homework lest you drop a lot of cash on a pair of beautiful torture devices.
Yet I number him in the song;
I'm sure many of you know Archie Moore had 131 knockouts throughout his career. As if his 185-23 record wasn't astonishing enough, Moore also fought in to his mid 40's where he wasn't he prime self. If he would have retired at a younger age, he wouldn't have the losses to Muhammad Ali, Rocky Marciano, Floyd Patterson, and others. But his skills were by no means deteriorating at that point. The last 10 fights of his career he achieved a 7-2-1 record. In todays day and age, that may not be considered a decent record but for a fighter in his mid 40's fighting top competition, that's an amazing way to end an already great career.

Hashemi asked them why. One of the girls who remained sitting—who is very active in school and who Hashemi sees as generally very “integrated” into German society—explained that, when students like her register for classes, they are placed in the “NDH” category, “nichtdeutsche Herkunftssprache” (translation: non-German language of origin). In other words, before they have stepped a foot in the classroom, a checked box on a school form differentiates them from their “regular German” peers.

But here, I can only see how it can be done exploitatively, with the aim of getting the schmuck to come back for more, and pay more money. What I have is, after all, a series of paragraphs strung together from a word-processing program, automatically, including my name at intervals, and a name for an astrologer who has putatively created this personally for me, and repeatedly refers to herself as “Your Professional Astrologer and friend”. It tells me that there is a major transit, a rare planetary motion, over the next three months, which will mark a decisive turning point in my love life and also my material wealth. However a transit can reinforce weak points, preventing growth and impeding progress, if the subject is not fully aware of their influence. This happened to me, it/”she” says, in 2008, when I was not aware of a transit, missed its opportunities, and this has caused blocks for me ever since. I need a guide I can trust. How wonderful that the universe has brought me to it, so it can guide me through this transit, and I will not suffer in the same way this time!

Although the SPC is a creation of EU law and its inclusion in the Court Agreement has some logic, it still looks a bit strange to have a national property right bundled up in the supranational Unified Patent Court Agreement. On the other hand, maybe it does make sense since standard European patents (which are in effect national property rights too, after grant and validation) will fall under the Court’s jurisdiction.

Many critics have pointed to the ambiguity of the figure of the governess in Victorian fiction, caught between upstairs and downstairs, and John said he thought that this was pretty central to the ambiguities of this novel, and pushed here to a particular limit. With what seemed to him something of a plot manipulation (the governess not allowed to contact her employer), James forces her into extreme isolation, a situation in which she has no employer to talk to but cannot talk freely to the servants, not even the housekeeper Mrs Grose of whom she longs to make a friend but from whom she must keep a certain professional distance, resulting in a deeply ambiguous relationship. (We hear in passing that she is also isolated from her family by the fact that they are suffering their own troubles, to which she will not add in correspondence.) John pointed out that James often names his characters symbolically (Miss Jessell, was, it seems, a Jezebel, as someone else in the group pointed out; one meaning of the name Miles is 'uncertainty') and John wondered about the apparent negative connotations of the name Mrs Grose, as well as its possible meaning of 'big'. Could it be that the housekeeper is a more significant element in this story than many interpretations have allowed for? It seemed to John that the housekeeper who appears so homely and dependable in the (unreliable) governess's eyes would in reality resent her arrival in the household, having previously been left to run it herself, and having been very close to the little girl Flora who must now remove her affections to the governess. It is interesting that at the end, when Flora turns against the governess and becomes frightened of her, Mrs Grose 'reclaims' her, even to sleep in her room, and then flees with her, albeit it with the governess's 'blessing'. Mrs Grose might well, in terms of social and psychological reality, want the governess out of the way. Could it be that the whole 'haunting' is a setup engineered by Mrs Grose to achieve that very thing?

The Brodzinsky team is even more blunt. “A good many adoptees consider the stress of adoption to be something they cannot change and would be better off ignoring so they can get on with their lives. These people reveal little inner turmoil about being adopted; they have either suppressed or denied or minimized the significance of adoption in their own lives.” And further, “Denial or avoidance….can be a highly adaptive strategy when an individual is faced with a stressor she cannot change, such as being adopted. In this view, an adoptee who can suppress, avoid, minimize, or deny the significance of being adopted….is able to compartmentalize this aspect of her identity and get on with her life.” And finally, “This is simply a coping style, and for may people it works…at least until a phone call from a birth mother or the uncovering of a genetic illness makes denial no longer possible.” (p.151)
This post really goes hand in hand with the last one on woman's cloth. A few years ago - probably around 4 - I started to occasionally have my periods at shorter intervals. I was introduced to Susun Weed's book, "The Wise Woman Way, Healing Wise". I borrowed the book from a friend, skimmed through it and read the pertinent parts. I started to make nettle infusions and to drink them on a regular basis. My menstruation irregularities disappeared. Now an infusion, as some of you may know and some of you may not, is not tea. Using 1/2 cup of dried nettle per litre or quart, you pour boiling water over the dried nettle and immediately put a lid on the jar or glass container you are using and let it sit for 4 hours. Then you strain and drink.

In the morning, Morrison catches them and joins them again, but they ditch him on Route Thirty-Four; they claim they're newlyweds on their honeymoon (who aren't wearing rings because they're Christian Scientists). Morrison angrily gets out, mutters "Young folks!" then goes on another one of his tirades before spitting on the pavement, and hissing to them, "You'll see... sailing along in that car, breaking all the speed limits. They'll get you."
During church he whispered some sort of comment in my ear that set my eyes rolling. My hand had been resting on his leg at the time. I picked it up and returned with one finger, tracing a large W on his thigh.

As I discussed in a previous post, human psychology probably also plays a role. According to prospect theory, when considering possible courses of action, humans weigh potential losses more heavily than comparable gains, and we evaluate both against a subjective reference point–usually the status quo. Psychologists call this pattern loss aversion, and it’s easy to see how it might strengthen the temptation for one-time “democrats” to cling to the spoils of power once in office.
The play I am currently involved in is a comedy. The story involves a property developer who wants to drive a lady out of her home so he can purchase the estate she lives in. My character is the very feisty lady who refuses to sell at any price. It all gets a bit 'Midsomer Murders' but the cast are having great fun at rehearsals. The play starts on March 9th so there are just under six weeks to go!
8 At the end of the World War II, with Communist and Kuomintang factions at war in China, the International Community and the Chinese assented to the Gold being placed under the overt control of Indonesian President Soekarno. Soekarno then, on August 17, 1945, came to be known as M1 under United Nations Approval No. MISA 81704 “Operation Heavy Freedom. This was because much of the world’s gold had been delivered into Indonesia and the Philippines. Canada, Australia, Great Britain, India and other British Colonies sent their gold to the so called “impregnable Singapore” The Japanese, as per the arrangements agreed to by Hirohito in the 1921 Pact Between Nations made in London, delivered much of this gold to Indonesia (Then a Dutch Colony) and to Philippines (Then a US Colony) into secret bunkers that had been mostly constructed by the Japanese between 1924 and 1945. This is why the Allied troops in Malaya had no air cover or sufficient supplies to that would have allowed them to resist the Japanese. Singapore had to fall so most of the global wealth could be “lost” into a secret system that made the gold standard redundant and fiat currencies a reality.

There are no pictures of the lotion squirted all over the bathroom floor, my diet coke spilled on the carpet, the files that got renamed because V got on the computer, the look on my face as I find him playing in an unflushed toilet... the spilled milk and cereal all over the floor because he climbed on the breakfast table, the trash strewn all over the kitchen because I didn't remember to put the trash can on top of the high chair like I usually do.

Today started off with a nice drive through rolling hills from Minneapolis. Actually, there wasn't one hill along the way until I hit Redwood Falls. It was a nice easy drive though. The Brau Brothers had a Group Brew day which I was lucky enough to get involved with. The Brau's put on a Homebrew contest each year where they take the winners recipe and brew up on their own equipment for distribution. This year the distribution of the winning American Black Ale, (CDA, Black IPA, etc) will primarily be distributed in South Dakota, with a few select locations in the Twin Cities receiving kegs, and 750 bottles. Dustin Brau lead the show, and encouraged all 20-30 of us to dough in, stir the mash, clean the lauter tun, and basically...if you wanted to participate in the brew day, you really could. It's a fantastic idea. You can only learn basic concepts from most brewery tours, but this hands on approach really helps you understand the intricate steps within the process demystifying a typical brew day! I can't say enough about the Brau Brothers family. They are just straight up, really good, story tellin, card playin, easy going brewers, just doing a really good job brewing quality beer. They are also growing hops, barley, and rye, and I'm sure some other things. There hops are on their 4th year of growth and they clearly are doing a good job as hop farmers because their Wet Hop Ale this year was frickin fantastic. If you haven't tried their 100 Yard Dash - fresh Hop, you may still be able to find a random 6er on the shelves of your local liquor store if you're lucky. It was extremely bitter, flavorful, and a slight aroma of locally grown hops. I will say that they could've been a little more heavy handed on the hops at the end of the boil on that one. Their Ringneck Braun Ale is my favorite Brown Ale brewed in Minnesota by far.

The word Church comes from the greek word Ekklesia, which means “assembly” or “gathering”. In Acts the original name for what is now the Church was The Way. But as the people of God, eventually called “Christians”, (“little Christ’s) began to gather daily and weekly, they referred to their gathering as a church (Makes sense). Eventually “church” replaced the title “The Way”. And now Church means much more than “gathering” It means an institution, a building, a place, a group. It doesn’t help to deconstruct the word and make our own definition. We can roll with today’s vernacular. But just know that when the coming Keene Church hears the word Church my hope as that Church’s pastor is that they will think first and foremost of the gathered people of God for the purpose of worship, whether they gather in Small Groups (House Church) or as a large Sunday Morning Gathering, not a building or an institution. My hope also is that their defininition of church doesn’t go beyond the fellow believers with whome they gather. So that as the individual House Churches gather throughout the week are part of one church, so individual gatherings that gather in Christ on Sunday Morning are part of the one greater Church of Keene, which are part of the one greater church of the whole world. Every believer is a brother or sister. Christ has one bride. She is called the Church. And she loves to gather in the name of Jesus Christ.
If this is the way the non-grieving public learns about grief, no wonder so few of us understand what grieving means until we find ourselves immersed in this strange new world. Because of the lack of characters who grieve properly, I’ve been toying with writing a book about a grieving woman, even going so far as to write a few scenes while the emotion is still fresh in my mind (though I can’t imagine ever forgetting what it feels like to grieve for a soul mate — every single day in a thousand ways, I am reminded once again that he is gone).
When the Holy Spirit is grieved, the anointing lifts.
It appears that a local seafood restaurant may soon return to old tricks, ready to stir up a hornet's nest of controversy with another blacklisted seafood dinner. But this dinner is sure to raise far more outcry than the previous one. There will certainly be loud cries of outrage, as well as renewed calls for boycotts, and National Geographic may be partially responsible for this matter.

So, off we set to our ever-growing list of spotted wildlife, which to date includes The various Fish, Shellfish, Seals, Sheep, Goats, Deer, Skuas, Cormorants and Gulls that I have already blogged about. But also Geese, Jackdaws, Herons and far too many blackbirds. Some of these I grant are less than exotic, but I cannot recall a holiday where the wildlife has been in so much abundance. There are still a few more spots to come in future blogs, the list is not complete yet. But, I digress, we headed out to sea once again, and spotted (And captured on film this time) many of the creatures we had seen the previous week, although this time, because of the high tide, the seals were in the water.

The plot. Well. At it’s core it’s just two old dudes having a tiff and by the end of it you just kinda want Otacon to cart Snake into a retirement home and be done with it. I kind of get why Snake was made in to this old geezer, to give the game a sense of finality as it is said to be the last MGS, but at the same time, I kind of don’t. Couldn’t they just roll with FOXDIE and use that as the reason why Snake doesn’t have long to live? Or was Ocelot too old for a younger Snake to beat the living crap out of? And why did the bosses have to be these fucking gorgeous women? I’m not really complaining, but I had to shake my head at the second stage of the fight: they just saunter up to you and try to hug you. And you’re supposed to, what, blast them with an auto shotgun? Right. Or you can just run away, a very hilarious concept, from the stunning women wearing skin-tight high-tech bodysuits that show off their mesmerizing curves and wait for the fight to teleport to a white room where if you take your camera out, these babes start posing for you. Then stuff your friend’s Ps3 hard drive with risqué photos for three minutes and you insta win. I honestly thought the Cobra Unit, which was just about the only thing that I felt was bad about MGS3, was kind of shit but the Beauty and Beast Corps take the cake.

Elwood was a New Jersey native who started off the 70s writing for wrestling magazines before turning his attention to compilations of SF and Horror, often working in conjunction with fellow editor Vic Ghidalia (when the latter didn't ghost-edit the volumes outright). During 1964-72 Elwood produced a relatively-few 13 titles, but 1973 & '74 saw a remarkable 39 books bearing his name, for a wide variety of publishers. The titles rapidly dropped off after that, and after 12 more volumes spread out over the next three years, books with the Elwood imprimatur disappeared. After about a decade of silence, Elwood, an avowed Christian, began producing novels with an evangelical focus. His writing ceased with the turn of the century, and he died in 2007.
Surely the lack of seating must impact on trade – it baffles me why pub owners sacrifice capacity in this way in the interest of appearing trendy. Maybe late at night they are packed with standing customers and too many seats would get in the way. But, for most of the day, customers are likely to be looking for somewhere to sit, particularly if they want to eat as well as drink, and in this particular establishment could easily conclude there was no room even if there were only about four groups already in the place. Wetherspoon’s are another major offender on this score – many of their pubs have vast areas of floorspace with a few freestanding tables dotted around, and often don’t seem busy even when all the tables are taken.

When Patrick contacted me about taking him and his wife Rachel on a 3 day backpacking trip I was excited but concerned. Did she know what she was getting into? Both were quite fit and competed in marathons and Iron Man competitions so that eased my fears some. It ended up that they were prefect clients! I gave them a list of gear that they should have, proper clothing, etc – they prepared! I let them know that they needed to try and hike a bit before heading out on this trip – they prepared! I followed up with them a few days before and advised that we would have some rain – they prepared! I could not have asked for better clients for this trip!

Since the last brew, I've gotten the feedback from the Austin Zealot's Inquisition, the Alamo City Cerveza Fest, and the Dixie Cup in Houston. I entered various beers in each contest. I'm at least hitting a consistent "good" rating. But good doesn't win me ribbons. There are a few of the comments on the judged beers that keep coming back: fermentation temperature control and water quality. Some beers may have sanitation issues in bottling. I'm about ready to tackle those two items. First, I need to get rid of my second vehicle, a '72 Ford Bronco. I could just kick it out of the garage and put a cover on it. Then I can get a few more chest freezers with temperature controllers and go to town. I'd want one for fermentation, another for lagering, and maybe a third for storing bottled beers and kegs that are waiting for room in the kegerator.

Moreover, the example of one movement could and did provide inspiration for other movements. A good example would be the feminist movement in the United States, which grew directly out of the experience that the women in civil rights organizations, where they developed skills to organize against their own repression experienced on a society-wide level while confronting the sexism they experienced within the civil rights movements.

Drew's a bit of a loner. She has a pet rat, her dead dad's Book of Lists, an encyclopedic knowledge of cheese from working at her mom's cheese shop, and a crush on Nick, the surf bum who works behind the counter. It's the summer before eighth grade and Drew's days seem like business as usual, until one night after closing time, when she meets a strange boy in the alley named Emmett Crane. Who he is, why he's there, where the cut on his cheek came from, and his bottomless knowledge of rats are all mysteries Drew will untangle as they are drawn closer together, and Drew enters into the first true friendship, and adventure, of her life.What I liked about this story was the way it transported me to summer time as a 13 year old. It made me reminisce about bike rides around the neighborhood, with the sun shining on my face, trips to the local public pool and to the park...the feeling of freedom and innocence all rolled into this one book.
According to the above verses Christ can do whatever the Father does, something that no mere God-fearing creature would or could ever say (especially one who is supposed to have been a Muslim) since the Father does the things that only God can do. Christ further informs his audience that he is the judge of all and that everyone must honor him in the same way that they honor the Father, which means that they must worship him as God since this is the kind of honor that the Father receives.
Before all the holiday craziness, my little Jackson turned three and we celebrated by throwing him a robot party.

Was it this artist’s intention to be offensive and controversial? Perhaps. But then, don’t we all also know instances when we say things we later regret? When a momentary emotional outburst was needed, but the burned bridges, salted fields, and desolate villages we leave behind were never considered? When we used napalm instead of ten calm seconds before we act? When we shoot first and ask questions later? When we express things that we feel at the moment, but don’t stop to think it would hurt people we care about? Don’t we all make mistakes in communication at times?

The weekend was a blur of brunch and dinner, high heels and hair spray, and speeches and tears. The facility they chose was non-traditional, but probably the most beautiful wedding location I’ve ever been to. It was an empty warehouse style room, with exposed brick walls, floor to ceiling windows, and etherial white drapes separating the ceremony space from the reception space. The color scheme was purple, grey, white, and black, and everything looked just perfect.

Back to the plants, and that hedge I mentioned. Even this high above the stream, midges can be a problem in the summer. For this reason, and because a low hedge would be nice, I'd like a hedge made of the insect-repellant herbs southernwood and lavender. I had a reasonable-sized lavender plant that I thought I could spare from its original destination under the fruit trees.

I really liked how this book discussed the Bronte sisters’ keen interest in women’s rights and how they incorporated this into their novels. All three sisters wrote about strong heroines that did not bend to the will of men and searched for meaning in their lives. I find it very interesting.

I just finished this novel the other day, and I'm still basking in the afterglow. I'm a little ticked I got it on my Kindle, because while I love the convenience of just grabbing the e-book in an instant, I would love to own the hardcover. I wouldn't call this cover beautiful, or shiny, and I wouldn't squee over it, but I do think it's compelling, and incredibly apt.

We all have big changes in our lives that are more or less a second chance. ~ Harrison Ford
See the smile awaitin' in the kitchen
The point of Allen's narrative is to caution against knee-jerk negative reaction to "daring, risky" Israeli military operations. Even high-ranking officials in Reagan's administration, including VP George H.W. Bush, Chief of Staff James Baker, and presidential aide Michael Deaver, advocated punitive actions against Israel in the wake of the surprise strike on Saddam's nuclear materials testing reactor in 1981, Allen remembers. But the most sober and far-sighted in the situation room--Reagan himself--after hearing all points of view on Israel, only "smiled and turned to the papers on his desk," and, when he did speak directly on Israeli policy, offered only private and pithy pearls of wisdom such as "Boys will be boys." There seems to be an implicit warning here to President Obama to curb any enthusiasm he might possibly have for condemning Israeli military policy, in this case regarding the Gaza blockade - or, more ominously, potential future Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.

Then came the much dreaded editorial letter. While I waited for my letter I heard all the stories about sixteen page letters, asking for everything to be changed except the kitchen sink (which appears only once at the bottom of page 137, in a paragraph that is going to get cut anyway.) When the letter came, I stared at it for half an hour before getting the nerve up to open it. I read through it. Something was missing. Where was the awful part? Where was the hard part that demanded I totally rewrite the entire thing? I had expected a moment of “this is too big, I can’t do it” panic. Instead, it all looked easy, and logical, and I was saying “Of course, that’s exactly what I want to do! Perfect! I couldn’t agree more!”
With just a tiny bit of prep during the weekend, a plate of delicious scrambled eggs is less than 5 minutes away. Seriously. You can time it. I’ll provide a recipe for you to try out, but really, the perfect weekday eggs are more of a method. When you have a little extra free time in the kitchen, pull out your food processor and puree some scramble-worthy vegetables and olive oil. I used a tomato, shallot, and parsley but I think mushrooms, zucchini, and/or spinach would be other good options. Store the concoction in the fridge and use it as the base for your scrambled eggs when you’re in a hurry. As a bonus, I found that this method yields consistently nice, soft scrambled eggs (as opposed to those dry, overcooked bits you might get when you’re rushing to get out the door and trying to multi-task…oops.) I’m not sure why this is, but I’ll take it.

Finally, in a tornado of limbs, sweat and fury, I yanked the curtain back and emerged: hair soaked with sweat, pride laying somewhere on the floor. Expecting to look like a product of Oktoberfest, I braced myself for the onslaught of my own reflection.
Lemuel Gulliver was a fictional adventurer who was the protagonist of the novel Gulliver's Travels, first published in 1726.
I hear music in the car and I think of Mr. Curry's eyes and his hands on me and how he tells me he loves me like he is thirsty and I am water and I think of our four children and their beautiful bodies moving in this world and their spirits so well loved and I know that I have everything. I also know that medications and insurance and these kinds of things that us poor people are so obsessed with talking about have the power to ruin our lives. If my husband takes the wrong magic pill because a psychiatrist should be evaluating him but instead an I-Phone is, that could ruin our lives. If he got sick enough badly enough he could end up hospitalized or leaving me or forcing me to leave him. All I can do is work full time and that is not full time enough.

But all of this positivity doesn’t stop at good habits. All of those points mean prizes, and DailyFeats gives its users an opportunity to pay it forward and give back to their communities. While the company does have a standard “Rewards Wishlist,” where users can request what they’d like to receive in exchange for the completion of their goals, the most accessible option is converting points into money and donating it to a non-profit. For example, every fifty points earned through DailyFeats can be converted into $1 toward the American Heart Association. Gidwaney says that the ethos is focused on developing and projecting social good for both users and brands alike.

Because of their otherworldly loveliness, and the way they made familiar woods seem completely alien, bluebells have an ancient and somewhat sinister place in folklore. Bluebell woods were regarded as portals to fairyland where unwise aesthetes could be trapped between worlds—or children could be stolen outright.

Last night I had two people come in and sit down, order 2 waters and nachos and sit for 3 hours. They said they weren't hungry and just wanted to talk. WTF!!!! I have 4 tables in my section and you are taking one away so you can talk. Can't you find someplace else to do that. Not to mention, when the restaurant is on an hour wait and there are lots of people wanting to eat and you are preventing them from doing that you are just a jack ass.

How's the actual gaming in GotY? The mechanics are what I like to call "pleasantly vague." Other than a few things like initiative and clerics, there's not much to indicate what flavor of D&D rules are being used at the table. Some 3E rulebooks are glimpsed, but at the same time the referees seem to freely alternate between using DM screens from AD&D 1E, AD&D 2E, Basic D&D, and WotC editions. This is really for the best, I feel. Excessive jargon would be a pointless way to pander to the audience that would detract from the story. And while the game mechanics and such are never the focus specifically, the filmmakers still found plenty of more subtle ways to demonstrate to the target audience that they know their stuff. Characters cleverly sport surnames like Dee, Mohan, Otus, and Martek. Gary Gygax, Dave Arneson, and Steve Jackson are referenced outright, but overall these are restrained, classy tips of the hat to the grognards out there.

"A mad sculptor, searching for the perfect realization of "the mask of horror", places himself in front of a mirror after smearing blood over himself with the glass of an oil lamp. He then swallows a virulent poison to observe the effects of pain."This is perhaps the first of the curious 'mad-artist' sub-genre of films which would go on to include Vernon Sewell's Latin Quarter (1945), Roger Corman's Bucket of Blood (1959), Herschell Gordon Lewis' Color Me Blood Red (1965), and other lesser-known fare. Unfortunately, beyond the synopsis, no other information could be found, and the survival status of the film remains unknown.

Here's what I left:
Lemon curd always makes me think of my mom. Mom loves lemon anything so lemon meringue pie showed up often when I was growing up. I do have her recipe and I know it is good but it uses cornstarch as a thickener along with egg yolks and water (that's right water, I had to do a double take the first time she gave me this recipe). No disrespect mom but I wanted to keep my recipe simple and focused on two techniques: mixing the eggs and sugar with a whisk or mixer until well blended and the cooking method. There are many recipes for making fruit curds. Some use yolks only or other additional thickeners or less butter or the addition of salt or more sugar and on and on (and water?!). I am not saying anyone of these recipes is wrong or right because as long as they work, that is right!
In always keeping my eyes on what I believe I've been put on earth and into this particular life to do, and in keeping that mission as my basis for determining goals and measuring my progress, I'm able to stay focused, find fulfillment, and ultimately, be successful. When I allow my purpose to grow murky (and I do, oh, how I do, time and time again!), I become unmotivated, and my activity/productivity levels drop, I waste tons of time seeking external STUFF to fill up my empty mind and soul. I feel bored and unfulfilled, and I end days and weeks and sometimes months feeling guilty and tired and disappointed in myself.
So there you go. Brian Coleman's tactic is "If you upset enough people, you'll get a whole new legion of voters". I was intrigued. I asked if they could introduce me to one of these newBrian Coleman voters. "Of course not, we don't share our supporters details with bloggers". I said that I didn't want their details, I just wanted to interview them, so that I could add some balance to my blog. "They don't want to talk to bloggers". I was surprised "Have you asked them that? They seem upset with our criticisms".
Australia Day is a celebration of many things. Of opportunity and equality, of aspiration rather than envy, of hard work and luck in equal measure and, best of all – freedom. Freedom to have an opinion and a say without fear of being locked up, freedom to write letters to the editor and show tens of thousands of people that you are a moron, freedom to drink lager or ale – or even wine if you don’t mind being thought just a little gay – and the freedom to support Manly, Collingwood or Queensland.
The other major historical monument is the Tour Montjoie. Built by Matthew de Beaumont in the 11th century, this 15m tall stone donjon replaced the original wooden version. It's understandably somewhat weathered now, but it's remarkably well-preserved given its age, apparently. (A restoration project in 1979-1980 probably didn't hurt.)
Perhaps most importantly, some players simply have a "Heroism Value" which dictates their character choices. They have the attitude that they're going to play their PCs in a heroic way, like Marvel superheroes or Conan the Barbarian! After all, would Captain American flee a losing battle and leave his peers to die? No way! Would Conan run away and leave a maiden at the hands of evil cultists? No way! (Well, he might consider it, but he wouldn't actually do it). By the way, I'm not implying that this heroism value equates to sure and certain suicide. But it certainly means that life and limb will be risked in fairly dire situations - because that's what brave fantasy adventurers do!
Hands and eyes work in different worlds;

Instinctively she moved towards the first small hut, searching for any clue as to where she was and what had caused the fire, but the toxic atmosphere made her cough and her eyes wouldn’t stay open. Then her eyes spied a heap lying on the floor and a flash of blue held her focus, as her eyes zoomed in on the object, realization hit it was a small teddy bear. This time her scream vibrated around the empty ghost town, she didn’t stop until she felt a small hand squeeze hers. She gazed down at the child that stood there and her whole body froze. Her features were tiny and perfect, big dark eyes and a small button nose with soft pink lips. She was beautiful.

I was reading “Complete Nutrition: How To Live In Total Health” by Dr. Michael Sharon, the other night. This book truly helped me realize how important protein is to the body. I also learned you have to be eating a complete protein (meaning a protein containing all the amino acids) for your body to properly absorb and use the protein. Now this is easier for people that choose to eat meat and animal products, but is still possible for people on a plant based diet. We just need to be conscious of this when we choose meals to consume. Sometimes this can require taking supplements, but you should speak with a doctor first before deciding to do so.
I cared to hear and converse, to argue to reach a truth. I felt afraid and recoiled to bed with my limbs shivering. For the most part though, I wanted to recede to myself, where none of it took place, where nothing at all takes place. It’s painful to be me and it’s more painful that I never want to break free.

A woman even older than I sits still with her eyes closed,
In a world full of men eager to control women’s bodies, to make our sexual decisions for us or to score points with neofeminists by parroting anti-sex worker dogma, I’m glad there are a few who have enough respect for women that they’re willing to speak up for our right to agency and self-determination even at a time when it isn’t politically correct to do so. That takes guts and character, and I am of the opinion that those traits deserve recognition wherever they occur.

As the accused successfully managed the litigation which he undertook to conduct there might at first view seem to be room for the contention that the complaining witness was not defrauded within the meaning of the provision of the Penal Code referred to above. But we believe that this position is not tenable. It would seem to be clear that one who, falsely representing his own qualifications, renders a service which the law expressly declares to be unlawful defrauds the person who in good faith reserves and pays for such services. In United States vs. Del Castillo (35 Phil. Rep., 413), this court held that a man who obtains the title deeds of another upon the false representation that he is qualified to represent him in litigation in a court of a justice of the peace is guilty of estafa.

The editor of the film, Doty Dorn, has said in interviews that her first responsibility as editor was to read the script several times. This is not normally the case with editors, who are more concerned with daily footage than over-arching plot. It is up to the director to decide the plot, the editor just assembles the cuts . . . normally. But in this film there is a special relationship between the editing and the story. The editing, more than the camera even, is what puts the viewer inside the character. There are aids, like Guy Pierce’s voice-over, but really it is in the pieces of information that are given at the beginning and end of each scene that helps us to find our footing.
Sometimes you have to stray from your path to truly appreciate it. I’ve learned not to be afraid of change and taking risks. We all have talents and passions.

I eat a healthy diet. I’ve been vegetarian for 10 years, and I recently became a vegan, due to some digestive issues and a possible link with my MTHFR polymorphism. Most of my grocery cart is full of produce, and I cut out my Diet Coke addiction and other sources of caffeine because they worsen my anxiety. Sure, sometimes I eat junk food and snack too much. I love Trader Joe’s sesame honey almonds, and Soy Delicious makes some amazing soy ice cream. But before I was either eating disordered or fat, I snacked sometimes too.

14. Volunteerism: Use volunteer opportunities to educate your children, not just about being a servant to others, but about life, choices, and even perhaps a trade. Habitat for Humanity allows older children to help. Most clothes closets and food pantries will accept help organizing, collecting, and distributing products. Nearly anyone can stuff bags with Bibles, toiletries, and candy to be sent overseas to soldiers. Older students can read aloud to the elderly or to young students. All of this valuable education is free, and priceless.
Does a person of benevolence never worry? Again, she may worry that her efforts to help a situation are not enough, and will act anyway. I think of my sister Christina Stewart in this regard. She and her husband are leaders of a global Christian charity called Impact Nations, delivering acts of service in many developing countries around the world, from Haiti to India. One who does not share their faith may disagree with the evangelical aspects of their ministry, but there is no questioning the positive effects they are having on the material conditions of the people they serve. I’m sure, for Christina, sometimes their efforts must feel like a drop in the bucket, and she must worry that they aren’t doing enough, but here she has her faith to sustain her, and she knows that it is better to act in spite of her worry and doubt, than not to help those they can reach. And always, she strives to do a little bit more.

Anyone who consistently works with words can understand when I say that writing is often a pleasurable torment. There is nothing more delightful than experiencing that pleasurable high when the day’s writing has gone well. Of course, the flipside means equal measures of frustrating torment when the words won’t come together and all that work gets axed by the delete button. But having good days and bad is nothing new, nothing to stress about, unless you’re on a tight deadline.

Since evolutionists have used fossils so wrongly for so long it is vital that we understand the true nature of the fossil. In reality animals or plants need to be buried quickly and thoroughly so they can be preserved and not just decay and be taken away by scavengers. In order for this to happen a flood or rush of sediment is the best way to fossilize something.
It has never been anything but a religion of the ambitious, dominating, and unscrupulous, with either a race or a caste arrogation of superiority over the races without or the herd within, an assumption of licence to act treacherously and injuriously towards aliens and those it deems of inferior breed and to confine its standards of honour and decency to those of its own blood or order. It is a code that Christianity has actively and passively resisted for two thousand years. That fact is not unimportant. For between the progress that has culminated in ergosophy and the Christian religion there is an intimate connection.

I’ve been told by some that “marriage isn’t just about sex.” I agree. But sexual love (EROS) is such an integral part of marriage that any marriage that lacks it is suffering from a shortage of love, just as a marriage that lacks any of the other three.

I am really not even sure where to start. And I hate resolutions, because I have made so many in the past that only end up in failure and shame. So....here goes a try. I'm going to go back to the old stand-by of setting SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, Timely) goals. And I think I am going to set Likely, Hopeful, and Crazy.
I first just drew a really simple tree trunk shape on the paper side of the fusible webbing. I used the pattern on my fabric as inspiration, don't get stressed about it, just a big simple shape is fine! Iron the webbing onto the brown fabric and cut the shape out on the drawn line.

09. The Returner
I was visiting with a friend last night and sharing stories of adventures in India. It was an adventurous time for me when I was there. I had no real plan and I had bought a one way ticket with no itinerary, no time constraints, no schedule, and was traveling alone. I remember when I was getting ready to leave several people asked me, “aren’t you scared?” Some people thought I was crazy to travel across the world to a place I’ve never been, alone. I though, was excited. The closer the date came the more I felt alive. As I flew across the ocean and the hours and miles began separating me from home I felt the excitement grow exponentially. I also felt fear of the unknown. I had no idea what to expect. I had no idea what life would bring to my feet when I landed. As I felt the fear of the unknown I also felt that the more we jump into the unknown the more alive we become. I was alert, present, conscious, on my toes, so that I didn’t miss a beat. I felt like my full being was completely immersed in the experience and my mind was silent because it had no comparison to relate the experience too, so all analyzing, criticising, and judgement stopped.
On Monday Bear goes to have blood work done and see a Doctor and have more tests done. Then on the 28th October he will start a series of injections, Filgrastim, to increase his stem cells. On 1 November they will remove the stem cell via taking blood, removing stem cells then putting the blood back into his body. It is called peripheral blood stem cell donation and if I had any medical know how, I would probably put it in better terms.

One way that Collins believes Turner can help is to develop and sustain his mid range game.

We spent Thursday hanging out at Mom’s, enjoyed a majorly awesome meal (where Jeremy and Grandpa split turkey carving duty), and then began the trek back to Kalamazoo. We got home at about 11 PM and set to unloading. Not the most ideal time to unload but since the truck was due back at 2 pm and I had to work Black Friday from 7 a.m. – 3 p.m. at Bath & Body Works… there weren’t many other options.

Oil two baking sheets and place the the slices of zucchini and eggplant on the sheets. Bake until softened - about 15-20 minutes. While those are in the oven, brown the ground beef, and mix in the spaghetti sauce. In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, eggs and spices. Layer the ingredients into a casserole pan. I put a bit of sauce in the bottom of the pan, eggplant, sauce, ricotta mixture, mozzarella, zucchini, sauce, ricotta mixture and mozzarella. Bake for 45 minutes to warm it through.
School. The kids love their teacher this year (Ben loved his teacher last year too, for the record). Both are enjoying what they are studying and homework is reasonable. They have been reading chapter books for some time now. Ben is into the Magic Tree House series and Riley is enjoying the box set of Roald Dahl Adam got her last spring. I have had to go into work early several mornings and the kids really enjoy walking to school from my office; it's only a block and a half. Otherwise they take the bus from our apartment in the mornings and then go to after school care until Adam or I can pick them up. DoDEA continues to amaze me with their schools; we had open house a few weeks back from 3:30pm-4:30pm. Needless to say neither Adam nor I could make it. Every Friday in November is a holiday; I couldn't even begin to tell you why.

* Europe – indeed, the original EEC – was defined by war and rivalry. The reaction to this has been (understandably, but unwisely) the hegemony of centralised social democracy with the accent on an equal, not a growing, cake. The American entrepreneurial model is almost entirely absent…in favour of stifling bureacracy that continues to spend and spend. (The US has spent unwisely to subsidise its banker, multinational business and Pentagon lobbyists; but it is winding down its government employee benefits, cancelling its social health commitments, and paring back the welfare system).
That trend was replicated throughout the league, which surely contributed to this season's excitement. Whereas last season the ball was in play for 62.39 minutes on average in Premier League matches, this season it rose to 64.42 – the most of any of the top five European leagues. Fulham (67.42min) offered the most action.

The worldwide Irish family numbers at least 50 million (some would say 80 million). The family analogy is a good one and merits teasing out. Why not do so? Take five or ten to reflect on where you stand on being Irish. Clearly you relate to Ireland – the Motherland – but is it confined to a feeling of bonhomie around St. Patrick’s Day? The chances are it’s something more than just pleasant sentiment (everybody empathises with St. Paddy’s Day) but actually defining what may be difficult. Now may be a good time to begin. Probably the intensity of your sentiments depends on the closeness of your links. Those born in Ireland, or the next generation, are more likely to feel strong affinity than somebody whose ancestors left Ireland in the 1850s. Have you traced your ancestors? Or are you close enough to the Motherland to count as an Irish citizen?

Jennifer Haigh excels at empathizing with families in crisis. Her writing may be painfully realistic but readers sense that she loves her characters with all their warts and wrinkles.

I rarely post status updates on FB and even more rarely do I post anything about school stuff. However, most of my FB friends are other homeschoolers, family members and old school classmates. The primary purpose of my FB usage is to connect with other homeschoolers.

Among the sparse trees, I sought for signs of farmers.

Now again, because this color combo is a darker one, i like to leave some areas white so when i go over the whole thing to blend, it doesnt get too dark on me. Also, when i add a a dark color as my main color, i do like to start with the edges/shadows first so that i can still see my stamp lines. Not always, but it is my norm with this particular color family. In this case, I've started with my shade color of E27 because there just isnt enough space in the image to get too wild with a bunch of different colors.

I may be alone a lot, but I still don’t think writing has to be as solitary as many people say. In fact, I think the internet offers a wide open community for writers with many different options. Yes, it’s a virtual community, but community none the less. Lets you know you’re not alone in the world. Now before anyone thinks I’ve lost my mind, no I’m not advocating just staying home and never venturing forth into the world, but I’m saying there are many sources of support for writers online.

As she helped the Afghans to create an independent media after five years of utter oppression under the Taliban, she came to deeply admire the character of the people. The Afghans had a great sense of humor, were practical, engaging, and keen to learn. The women and girls, having been denied an education under the Taliban for five years, were passionate about their schooling. And then there was the stunning landscape that informed the Afghan culture in every way.Because Lisa is a photojournalist, she took photos everywhere she went. In 2003, when a girls’ school in a village where she was teaching was burnt down by opponents of educating girls, she documented the wreckage–then became totally caught up in the determination of the 200 girls and the school principal to rebuild their classrooms and continue their education.

For my own novel, which is Sci-Fi/Fantasy Romance, it got me thinking how I could use some type of allergy idea and if it would fit. Despite an advanced technological society, if you are not located someplace with access to it, you could still perish without human intervention. My protagonists are traversing a jungle to reach the main city. While they have medical and technical advances, they are far from civilization. So, an allergy could fit in to my story very well. I have the setting to create tension with this idea.
2. Go to Yaston (Neutral World) and go to their well. Use the Poisoned Fairy water on the well. Sometimes, the well is already poisoned from other players. You can check on the status of the well by talking to the woman at the well. If she goes on about it having the sweetest well water, poison away! If it's poisoned, you may need to get the Blue Fairy Water (or ask a player to do so). For reference, the Blue Fairy Water is on the top of Thenton Tower where players need to jump off; the water is on a tile next to the stairs, just search/hit center when standing on it.

These boar chops differed a bit in cut from the ones in the class, but I thought they’d do quite nicely. There were four chops with small bones – nice and thin, and a bit small, which told me that these came from a smaller pig, which is what I’d been told to look for. I rubbed them with sea salt, pepper, oregano and thyme, and fired up the grill.

Jenko eavesdrops on Schmidt’s pathetic attempt to ask Melodie to the prom and makes fun of him causing Schmidt to choke up and run away.

I spent the majority of my Friday off work in Asda due to an unfortunate incident with one of their cereals. Whilst Tom was innocently munching away on some Choco Flakes he caught his tooth on some sort of mini stone/seed hidden within it and has broken his front tooth. Literally half of it has just crumbled off. They had an "If you're not fully satisfied" number on the back and obviously he wasn't that satisfied so gave it a ring, apparently it's now under investigation but I'm hoping they offer some sort of compensation, we're both quite passive when it comes to complaints but it's going to cost £200 to get his tooth fixed so I think it's only fair that they foot some of the bill? Or do you reckon we're being a bit cheeky?

Highlight the bold side of nature’s palette by creating your own display with a few easy to find materials. First pick out the style & number of frames for your wall. On a piece of cold press board (a sturdy textured paper) paint the outline of the paper about an inch big using imperfect strokes using frisket ( a liquid that masks areas you don’t want painted.) Pick out different branches of foliage, the best flowers and leaves to use have defined shapes avoid slender stems or wispy leaves. Try to collect pieces that lay flat for a bolder look then paint over them using your favorite color spray paint using spring colors for a bright new edge in any room.

Light. Pure, golden light penetrated through my eyelids. At first, there was wonder. Where had the light come from? Then shrieks and screams came from the dark ones around me. They were screaming a name! I couldn’t understand why they were so afraid. I could almost feel the delicious light as it poured over and around me. It brought a warmth to inner soul as nothing else ever had. With my eyes still closed, I listened as the shrieks and screams died away. I could sense that I was alone…except for the light. Slowly, ever so slowly, I opened my eyes for the second time that night and felt my breath catch in my throat. He was standing there. I recognized Him even though I had never seen Him before. Jesus…

I'm feeling fine...and loving all of the mini symptoms I've experienced thus far. I'm getting a little more fatigued during the day, my sense of smell is that of a bloodhound, looks like I've had a boob job, intermittent cramping, and some lower back pain. All of these symptoms come and go. I actually feel...normal. Sometimes I forget that my body is going haywire inside right now! Hopefully these are signs of a viable pregnancy.

One of my literary heroes, whom I’ve already mentioned, is Philip Larkin. “Geographers are firmly bound to place. Space is not homogeneous: something always happens somewhere; everything takes place. Larkin takes the opposite view; he is the poet of undifferentiated space.”[6] Even a poem like ‘Here’ – ostensibly about a place (on the surface, Hull)…
The last step is to take a razor blade (I think you can buy a special tool by Band-It, but you don't need it if you've got a box knife) and slice off all the extra bits of edging hanging on the sides and end so that it's the perfect width for the thickness of the plywood. I noticed after the fact that you can see the "seam" where they've connected two pieces of the edging together. This could be obvious with lighter stains but since we were going dark I wasn't worried about it too much.

In response, a spokesperson for the critics (who prefers not to be named) voices words of protest: "We believe that good critics, first and foremost, must be good writers," she declares. "I have met excellent musicians who can't tell the difference between "their" and "there" and who, frankly, have no clue where to put their apostrophes. Some of them can scarcely spell their own names, let alone the words "persuasive", "occasionally" and "Massachusetts". The musical profession, having concentrated its training on the perfection of performance, sometimes neglects the general education of budding performers to a very unfortunate degree. Consequently, you cannot expect a good musician necessarily to be a good critic. This panel will test only one part of the picture, and not necessarily the best part."
The Philadelphia sculptor of kinetic abstract sculptures has floated above the recession. He had a banner year in 2009, with a record $41.5 million worth of his art selling at auction, according to Artnet, a firm that monitors sales. Six of his priciest pieces sold during the doldrums, including the 1934 mobile, "Five Pieces of Wood," which Sotheby's in London sold last June for $4.2 million. On Wednesday, another pair of mobiles sold for a combined $5.2 million.

I finally told him I didn’t want him involved with the household finances at all because he was such a nightmare to deal with and he didn’t help with anything. I won’t go into the issue of his misappropriation of funds… I learned my lessons about that years ago – one reason I did not have any joint accounts with him where he would have direct access to my income.
Opening track Rangda sets a very different tone than anything previously heard with the use of the Gamelan at the forefront of the mix, laying a hypnotic groove and slightly creepy feeling. It’s a bold way to start but one that builds the tension and anticipation. Cyclin comes next with a more familiar brass-driven sound. Organ and guitar battle, layering the funk as the mood lifts up a notch or two. Togetherness drives on into full Afrobeat and funk. For fans of earlier material, it’s here that the album really hits.

Elvenstar is a purely hunter-jumper barn with its rider base made up of mostly juniors. Because of this, the big focus is on equitation. I must say that I am incredibly thankful for that focus since I feel that it has largely contributed to my riding style today. When I was younger, according to the head trainer, I "didn't have a rider's body," and was therefore shunted from the hunter and equitation competitions to jumper ones. But, the lessons were the same and I still learned a good deal about showmanship, rhythm over a course, and subtle aids.

I was really excited to try Yaktrax Pro because without fail, I have a good fall every Winter. Fortunately for me, the lack of snow has made running a lot easier. Unfortunately, it makes making a review for Yaktraxs hard when there is no snow. On New Year's Day, we got an ice, slush, snow mix and made a good testing ground for the Yatrax. I have delayed this review only because I was POSITIVE that we would have some more snow. Well....It is the middle of February and we still have nothing (you won't hear me complain!!).
As January wore on, my suppliers were getting nervous I’d not paid them yet. I kept telling them the insurance cheque would arrive shortly and then they’d get paid. A few, but not many, put me on hold or COD and that made it all the more difficult to service what little business we did have. I called the life insurance company late in January asking when the cheque would be coming and they told me they were waiting for the police report to arrive before releasing payment.

Can't you see that all that stuff's a sideshow
We finished downstairs and went upstairs, (crazy people that we are, we were doing it in the wrong order) and went through the living room, bedroom, bathroom and kitchen showrooms. It was like playing in a giant sized dolls house, where all the normal travails of life are swept away and problems solved with clever units and stowaway solutions.

Hi everybody! I am here to announce the winner of the July 30th Blog Hop. All the DT's cards were so beautiful, thank you so much girls!
I remember when James and I loaded our ugly, thrift store furniture into a truck, boxed up all of our belongings, and moved into the neighborhood near your street. You were one of the very first people to say, "Hello!" But you didn't just say hello. You wrapped your arms around my waist and kissed my cheek and made me feel like I had stepped into the sunshine. It was warm and wonderful, and I knew we would be friends. You were one of the first to love my family. And you were easy to love in return.

Thailand’s military culture has always allowed for the use of force when opposition calls out, and has been seen multiple times over the past three or four decades with violent crackdowns against its own people during mass demonstrations, whether peaceful or not. If strength and force can be used against their own people, it is not a far cry to pushing out those who may not culturally belong in Thailand; those who create a heavy burden on the country and who originally were meant only to be temporary residents but have now been forced to create permanent settlements. (For more about Thai military crackdowns through an anthropological lens, an excellent book is Funeral Casino: Meditation, Massacre, and Exchange with the Dead in Thailand by Alan Klima).

He said “Don’t be ridiculous”, and turned to my Mum and said “Take her home”. Then he stormed off. I remember everyone else turning away from me and muttering amongst themselves. Mum took me home and said “Why did you make a scene, couldn’t you have just accepted what he said?” I said “Mum, it seems to me that we just accept whatever the priest says and aren’t supposed to question it, but, what if he’s wrong?”. Mum said “He isn’t wrong, he’s the priest!”.
These last two are honorable mentions simply because number 6 is a short film that isn't entirely about ballet, and number 7 is...something indescribable and not recommended but included because they should be applauded for whatever it was they attempted to do there.

Many friends have asked me why it’s important to me to be out at my job. And I have to say that it’s not so much about being out as it is about not having to hide who you are. I spend many years of my, rather young, life in the closet and it felt stifling. There’s no air in there and once you’re out where there IS air, you don’t want to go back in, don’t want to have to watch every word you say to people. A partner may be a big part of your life; you don’t want to have to hide that person. It’ll put strain on the relationship, because what person really wants to feel like they’re a liability to their partner?
Single-treatment studies
What is the need in todays senerio is to provide best and customized treatment which is most suited to that particular person. Still there is huge common cohort of osteoarthritic people who can be offered either TKR or HTO. Responsibilities lie upon we doctors to see what procedure suits most to that particular person, rather then driven by many other things.

I'm also thinking of various topics. For example, one of the things I touched on but didn't go in-depth with in Cyberlama was the idea of defining life. Two of the scientists in the book had an on-going debate about what microorganisms were considered to be alive. That debate is interesting to me, so I thought I could make more of it in my new book. But I also wanted to explore social media and the idea of connectedness. That's another scientific project. So, do I now have a group of scientists to work with? Maybe, I wouldn't want all of my characters to be scientists. Or maybe I do?
The Prussian King was furious. He continued the description of his dream. He said that the struggle between the two stars had been long and forceful, but that his own star had escaped – with great difficulty – and taken its place again, continuing to shine in the sky, while the other one had disappeared. He wanted to know if his astrologer still thought that Prussia would be dominated.
I feel the most useful place to start is by explaining that Game of the Year (GotY, hereafter) is, in essence, a "mockumentary" in the style of Rob Reiner's 1984 classic This Is Spinal Tap, as well as that film's own star Christopher Guest's subsequent similar series of works (Waiting for Guffman, Best of Show, etc). This means that GotY is meant to depict real people being followed around and recorded by a documentary film crew. These sorts of films are actually scripted, of course, but the "raw" seeming camera work and heavy use of improvised dialog encourages the audience to suspend their disbelief on that score.
You stand there. You are unsure what to do. Should I just look at her and walk away? Should I stay and talk to her? This is where I was stuck for some time. She sucked me in. She never took a bite, I don’t let anyone take a bite out of me! Stay away darkness.

Those transsexual Thai people endure unimaginable sufferings bravely and quietly from as a child and their life expectancy is only about 40 years old. But in their short lifetime they have gotten their family through difficulties and brought the world a lot fun. Many women visitors wonder at their beauties and tenderness. Those beauties are called “Lady boys” or third sex” and more accepted than any other country in the world.

Here's a last little note about context: The next stage of human (cultural) evolution involves the reinvention of the generalist (the role of philosophers in the enlightenment comes to mind as an analog). In the past 100 years we have delved deeply into many areas of reality, both through science (Einstein, Heisenberg, etc.) and through religion (Martin Luther King Jr., Mohandas K. Gandhi, etc.). It is time to integrate all that we have learned and to purposefully apply it to the world which we create every day.

And an apology for it not being the kind of yarn I usually like.
God, Girls and Getting Connected is a fantastic devotional that will reach teen girls right where they are. There is a ton of reflection questions and activity's for girls to read and do as they discover truths God, Identity, Relationships and Life (or GIRL, the acronym used in the book). The topics are all relevant and fresh, without being preachy, an appealing method of teaching for sure. This is a superb gift idea for any teen girl in your life, particularly for graduation, which is just around the corner for many.
Children are to obey their parents, as long as their parents are asking them to do things within the limits of the Word of God. If your father or mother orders you to steal or murder, then you do not have to obey them because you must be obedient to the clear teaching of the Word of God. The same applies to wives being submissive to their husbands.
It’s very good, it's inventive. It has been done before of course, Cheap Trick did it, but it's not a bad idea. I don't know how it's going to work out financially though.
Even though I am in a very different place than I was in last year at this time I have so much to be thankful for. I am not working right now but that has been a blessing in disguise so I am thankful for that. I have made the huge decision to go back to school and I am still working on getting to goal and becoming more healthy. My family is healthy and happy. My relationship is in a good place. I have wonderful friends and a fabulous support system. I am thankful as well for all of the bloggers that offer a kind word and help to keep me motivated to do better and keep going. I am truly blessed and thankful for all of those blessings. I hope you all have a wonderful Thanksgiving and that you get to spend it with the people who love you best.

Diesel and I went over to Debbie's for a visit. We had a run in the pasture. We petted the horses and had tea - with fruitcake. I know what you're thinking.

So on the subject of Lemonade or at least a subject in the citrus family.... I wanted to share a recipe I found yesterday on Face Book.

I just have to make this cake for our Memorial weekend get-together.
From her nickname, Spicy, you might imagine that my friend has fair skin, fiery hair and a hot blooded Irish temperament. She couldn’t be more different. Instead imagine the girl-next-door with a sweet spirit, wavy brown hair and a slightly Mediterranean /Middle Eastern complexion. Like my nickname, Grace, hers is ironic. Our nicknames were given to us by Cornerstone’s philosophy professor Dr. Bonzo, somewhat as a joke, during a philosophy conference we went to in our undergrad. Having agreed that it’s weird having a friend with the same name, we prefer our nicknames.
Lorraine calls the cake “I Can’t Believe You Made That Cake”, saying it gets such a reaction from other people. I’m going to call it CHOCOLATE FINGER CAKE.

Was there a sadness there? Or was she just bored, sitting there waiting for her mother or her husband. I sometimes have moments like that myself. You stare into the distance and suddenly realise that you've lost twenty minutes. As I was watching her a pigeon landed near her. I guess it had seen some crumbs or something. I hate the fucking things myself - rats with wings.

And in the midst of all of it, simply gave myself over to a life that was all about pleasure…all about me…all while talking myself into the idea that it wasn’t really evil, and it wasn’t really all that bad: Heck, as long as I made sure to get to church from time to time, sit in on the service, and tell God I loved Him…that ought to take care of the “religious” side of life.

It was covered with stains. I can't describe half of them put the two most obvious ones were shit, food and blood. I wish that last one was a joke. I don't know who the last owner was or what she did to the kid but it frightens me a bit. And this woman expected Sita to use it for her own kid, it's just disgraceful. Since it was so bad we decided that just throwing it away wasn't good enough. This bassinet had to go out in style. So we sat on the deck and just threw out ideas out what to do with it for a while.

In any event, the book features some truly stunning and imaginative work: the organic blobs of Anders Pearson, the Duchampesque watercolor scrawls of Casey Camp, Henrik Rehr's shifting currents of densely packed lines, Mike Getsiv's suggestive, boldly colored swirls, Warren Craghead and Richard Hahn's mastery of panel rhythms, the unexpected visual gag inserted into Geoff Grogan's multimedia collage, Alexey Sokolin's forbidding stormclouds of black scratching, Andy Bleck's sensual scribble figures, Derik Badman's renderings of only background fragments from old Tarzan comics, the multiple contributors who turned in dense, virtuoso ink pieces towards the end of the book. Not everything here is at the same high level, but it's a surprisingly consistent anthology, unified by its theme and Molotiu's commitment to including pieces that advance his definition of this particular approach to comics. What's best about the book is how open its territory ultimately is, how much room it leaves for artists to come up with their own ideas about abstraction and sequence. It is a truly groundbreaking book that points the way towards a whole new conception of comics and challenges readers and artists alike to explore this new area. [buy]

Bengalis do tend to have large families and this is the third most deprived borough in the country. Overcrowding is a serious issue. But other Bengalis I know in the area had told me that it was very unusual to have any more than five adults in one house. The households are large, they said, because they have lots of children – not lots of adults.

ME.... I decided it was time to get to know my front lawn a bit better.... You see I live in a small gated community and I am the first corner house. When I moved in (almost 3 years now) I was much more interested in making sure the flower beds looked great and pretty much ignored the lawn. It had weeds, but when I came home from a walk with the dogs on Saturday I noticed that there were more weeds than grass on the lawn... And not the nice weeds... but the mean one... PUNCTUREVINE!

In such an environment, exceptional job performance is both required and expected. In a high-pressure workplace, when you lead a team of 70 people, it is imperative that everyone knows what is expected of them at all times. In my company, we formalize those expectations in writing, and through regular performance dialogs we check on how people are performing against those expectations. One of the ways we accomplish this is by setting up goals and objectives for them. In work-related terms, this is a good thing; people sometimes get off track, and goals and objectives help keep people aligned and moving forward at a similar pace and trajectory.

Libraries needn’t be grand. The castle was eventually replaced by an old warehouse, which offered space and parking, and didn’t seem to cramp Curious George’s style–just like kids, he’s curious anywhere. For a while, a children’s branch anchored a shopping center.

The ride home was uphill, but my excitement made the ride easier.

So having a few paragraphs of description of a character, their life, family history, their personality, and why they believe that their kingdom is the most wonderful place to be and how they are going to convert everyone to this line of thinking is great and rich, I think that the belief of “My kingdom of Hynthral is a just and fair place, and I will not rest till the barbarians of the outlands see the light” gets lost in everything else.

I should explain something first: The warning "beep" that tells me my lights are on when I exit the vehicle no longer works. I put on all the lights when it's snowing or raining really heavy like it was today. Twice this winter I had to get Gord to "boost" me at different locations of city. He kept on saying we should get this fixed.. never did. Today....while it was raining I was well aware of NOT turning on the lights....because sure as hell I would forget to turn them off. I had three different stops to make .. and at the last one at Safeway I turned off my windshield wipers before I went in ... or so I thought. I have no idea why I would turn off the windshield wipers because ...hey they stop all on there own when you turn the truck off. Fudge..... I turned the stinking lights on. Wrong switch...

As I pointed out in my first post, you don’t need to be abused in order to be diagnosed as BPD, however, I do think that most people who have BPD were abused or neglected as children; therefore, I disagree with the last misconception.

One side note: this is something where you start with basically nothing; just maybe an outline, or character ideas, notes, whatever – but the point is that you start something fresh, not something half-written already. You write said novel in that month. Since I’ve only ever written a very basic outline, and one snippet of dialogue between two characters for my Dystopian novel, “The Wilds People”, I want to use this as my platform to get on with it already.

Lead Generation: You want to have an amount of income roughly equivalent to your previous job. Whether that’s per hour or total amount, it’s a decent rule of thumb when starting out with a franchise. So you need to drum up clients. The biggest part of your job early on is to find people interested in the work you do who are willing to pay you for it. You need to learn personal interaction skills, presentation skills and refine your elevator pitch — a short and sweet presentation no longer than an elevator ride.
It’s not for me to say here, but apparently the guests all spoke very highly of the evening as a whole and felt that the night was something just a little bit special.

Last July’s rally, more than 10,000-strong, ended in violence when police fired tear gas and water cannons at the yellow-shirted protesters, drawing criticism of a heavy-handed response and sending Najib’s popularity sliding. His approval rating has since rebounded to 69%, according to one poll.

Well another 2.7lbs off and another 3.5 inches gone from my bust and waist, which means I have lost 12.5% of my body weight so far! I’d definitely say that I have achieved a lot more than I’d hoped for on this Fast Track Challenge. Admittedly, I haven’t followed the Menu Plans strictly, but they gave ideas on how a balanced meal should look, and the portion sizes were a revelation. Eating more vegetables, nuts and dried fruit has improved the quality of my snacking and bulked out my meals in a less detrimental way than adding more carbs.

If you look at President Obama’s speech the other night, what did he lead with? He lead with manufacturing. He led with manufacturing why? Because the base of his party, the ones that are always the ones — not the base — the swing vote in his party, the ones that Ronald Reagan was able to get — we call them Reagan Democrats up in Pennsylvania. Those are the blue-collar working people of America who know that this president has left them behind. He has a plan for them, and it’s more dependency, not work, not opportunity.
Our Social Worker confided in me that just prior to having her first child she moved house and into a small village. She explained how difficult it can be to join established groups of mums and she made it her daily task to find a playdate each day. I took up this challenge when Katie came to join us and I still joke that I'm on a playdate mission. Katie had lived her life until that point in a very busy foster carers house. She was used to lots of children around and we were concerned that moving to a very quiet house with just the three of us would be an enormous culture shock for her. We knew that it was vital that we had lots of playdates.

Contentment seems to be one of those words that people either consider positive or they give it a negative connotation. It reminds me of complacency in that regard. Complacency has a negative connotation for many people and yet, when I look at the definition, contented self-satisfaction, I see it as a very positive place to be. I’d like to think that the same people who see complacency in a negative light also see contentment in that same negative light, since they are so closely related. I, however, am not one of those people.
I am angry.

I don't usually do a lot of family pictures but this is a picture of my oldest granddaughter, Rachel. She is fourteen. I had to work this weekend so we could not have all the little ones over. As she and her Papa can fend for themselves, she came alone.

2) Be a good listener. You will need to (calmly) listen to your friend explain why you just have to help them along with any gruesome details they will undoubtedly share. Under no circumstances utter the phrases; Oh my God! What were you thinking? or How could you be that stupid?
I don’t do a lot of scolding. I don’t call her a naughty girl (unless I’m kidding) and I don’t usually express a lot of anger. If I AM angry, I figure I’m expressing it by the spanking. I know some couples do find that scolding helps, but we choose not to. We talk ahead of time to make sure she’s clear as to why she’s getting spanked because I find she’s often unclear. Sometimes I tell her what I expect of her and why she’s getting this spanking and how I want for things to be different.
A great season starter, though it dragged a bit at the beginning of the second hour. I look forward to seeing what’s to come. I won’t be staying up til midnight again on a Sunday night (yea tivo). It has taken me 2 days (at the time of writing this) to recover. I wish I could say I had too many martinis, but alas, I had one very good, very dirty martini.
The two models for teaching, direct and indirect, both have their own individual strengths and weaknesses, but neither needs to be mutually exclusive. Effective teachers should embrace both strategies providing opportunities and variety for their students. Limiting yourself to just one style or strategy of teaching is also limiting your students to one direction of learning. Students are diverse and learn in multiple ways, thus incorporating both direct and indirect instruction into daily lesson plans provides for a good opportunity to embrace all types of learning habits that may exist in the classroom. But, direct instruction and indirect instruction have their strengths and their weaknesses, which is important to understand so that lesson plans are appropriately and effectively designed.
The body’s ability to move is normally shut down in the theta state. It is the brainwave level that we normally experience during dreams while we sleep. Training yourself to stay awake in a theta trance state will help you learn to expand, move and control your etheric energy. If you can maintain this level, with eyes wide open… it can also help you learn to see the etheric life force around people, plants and animals.

I've been making homemade yogurt for over a year now, and was thrilled to discover how easy it really is.Our family goes through a lot of yogurt! This past summer, the kids and I were given a free sample of Greek style yogurt at the store. Oh boy! One look at the cost and I knew I had to come up with a way to make it at home.

A killing sets off the worst riots in modern times, and it is seriously suggested by the authorities that people should be kept in the dark. It is a matter of overwhelming public interest that the truth should be ascertained so that the lessons can be learnt.

8:15am – The door to the practice swung open and a harried woman appeared, surprised to find me and my twiddling thumbs. “Is anyone here?” she asked me, with a puzzled look on her face. Do I look like I work here? I said to myself. I politely responded that, no, I appeared to be the only one in the office and that I was waiting for my 8:00 appointment. She shoved a clipboard with blank forms into my hand, settled herself in at a desk directly behind the sliding glass reception window, and phoned my PT to ask if she was, in fact, coming in. Naturally, she did not reach her, and left a message.
Well I cant say that spring has really sprung in NYC. I hope that you are luckier than we are. I got this great picture from my friend Dylan Driessen and she really has the right idea. She is making her own spring by painting every nail a different hue. I just love it when you guys get creative. There are times that our nail color should be serious and there are times that we should have a fun happy accessory, right?

This is a close up of the decoupage, which I cut out by hand. I wasn't so sure at first about cutting out my own decoupage but with a good pair of little scissors, it is fine and the results look stunning!
It has long been one world. Social, political, and economic trends emerge across the developed nations, denying the existence of borders, varied cultures and languages. For a powerful analysis of one such period see Three New Deals by Wolfgang Schivelbusch, “Reflections on Roosevelt’s America, Mussolini’s Italy, and Hitler’s Germany, 1933-1939″. In many ways three (4, including Japan) different revolutions, but with profound commonalities.
When Metzger stated there was no direct object, he was in reference only to the Alexandrine manuscript which did not include US. It’s entirely arbitrary conjecture to say it wasn’t there because the A didn’t have it. The word “us” IS the direct object. The very fact that all the other manuscripts had US and the very fact that it is the very direct object that is stated to be NEEDED, that should tell us that it was the actual original reading. It makes perfect grammatical and syntactical sense. To claim the original text didn’t have a direct object, based upon ONE manuscript, and leaving the sentence syntactically awkward, is clearly a position that can’t be defended without presupposition and conjecture. Why Bruce so strongly defaults to the Alexandrine in this case is a bit of a mystery. Why would one assume that the Alexandrine is the BEST witness for Revelation?

Should you happen upon one who has fallen into a well and desire to get him out, you don’t jump down into that well with him. Rather, you stay on top, lower a rope, ladder, or the like, and bring him up to the surface to join you. That is what Christ did and as ambassadors of Christ, we do as well.
The holidays are just around the corner. Whether you are prepared or not. With all the cooking and shopping we do for others, we often forget about ourselves and our wardrobes. I know it’s the season of giving, but you’ll feel better giving in style, right? Well I haven’t forgotten about you or your holiday style needs. So with your schedules and budgets tightening up this holiday season, I’ve found some LBDs that won’t break your bank account.

Step 5 - Blend your colours together with your lighter skin tone (E50 here). Now for blush, you can either tip-to-tip or use the palette blending technique. I chose to scribble some R20 onto the bottom of my acetate since it was already on my desk and then picked up the colour with my E51 Marker. I chose the darker one because I wanted rosy cheeks - but I will often do it with the lighter skin tone (E50) - depends on the image you are using.
I liked how the whiteness of the pearls brought out the white chrysanthemums.
I used the Playful Parlour kit from SVG Cuts to cut out the box. I created my own little box inside to be able to put the ballerina on. I punched a hole and then put a little pink eyelet in it, then I took some floral wire and wrapped in a spring shape and attached it to the ballerina and then through the hole to the box. I did this so when you close the box and then you open it up again she will pop back up. For the little girl I used Lettering Delights Glam Girls Paper Dress up SVG set.

Accuracy lies in questioning persons of interest long enough to observe their default behaviors. People who feel anxious usually either freeze or defend themselves, thus displaying behaviors of discomfort. While there are no hard-and-fast rules, the types of behaviors that can signal discomfort, and thus potential deception, include:

Three weeks in remand!?… I had stayed out of such troubles when it comes to drugs, but now I was going to prison again regardless! I had the urge to “say something” to the judge – as I had on 31 Oct 2005 when I was ordered to be sent to Pusat Serenti Gambang. And the intended words weren’t very nice on both occasions.
Now we’ve arrived at a place where even Tweeting is taking too long. There was huge wave of negative publicity directed at members of Congress who spent more time thumb-wrestling their BlackBerrys than paying attention to the recent presidential address before a joint session of Congress.

He asks her if she knows anything about the envelope Chi San had with him when they met for coffee and she acts like she’d been worried about it too because they’d somehow gotten switched. Owning up to it is obviously a good move because that way, she can feign some innocence. Yi Gak is a dummy so he swallows it whole but shouldn’t the first question be why she had a ticket for Park Ha in her possession? Then why she didn’t try to get the lease to its rightful owner? Surely there would have been a name on it. Moving on…

my Remington Noiseless Portable #7. That’s my first typewriter. My dad bought it for me at a garage sale when I was in junior high.

Uruguay was a spontaneous trip that we decided to do last-minute. Being so close to Buenos Aires, we couldn’t resist a visit for at least the weekend. There are different ways to get to Montevideo over land: from the most expensive direct ferry, to the longest and cheapest bus routes. We opted to meet in the middle. Our journey started on Saturday taking the 9:30 am ferry from Buenos Aires. After 3 hours of a comfortable ride on the La Plata river we arrived at Colonia, Uruguay.
How joyful the moment was when we drove up a red-balloon lined driveway to our little house where our three older children waited with open arms for their new sister--it was amazing.
If you have family who loves you ......who wants you......call them. Go and see them. Hug them. Make up and apologize to one another. Find the best in one another. Overlook their shortcomings. Pray for them. Forgive them. Bless them. Write to them. Prefer them over yourself.......remember to love.
Let's face it; we like the sweetness of the sauces because the corn syrup hits our blood stream and shoots right to our brains. And the MSG heightens all of the flavors in much the same manner so we just want to eat everything on the table in a crazy hurry because it just tastes so darn good. At least, that was the problem for me. I'm sure there are more issues with ingredients (not the least of which are quality and origin), but those two seem to be the triggers for me.
I did about six more months of revisions with her--both on the text and the sketches--before we submitted my manuscript to publishers. I was really happy with the submission, and I felt like it was as shiny as it could be.

Hi Everyone, I know it's been a while since I posted anything, but I've been very busy on a very important project.

1) Exercise. If a dog is properly exercised, the occurrences of obsessive barking are almost entirely eliminated. Walking, jogging, or biking with your dog are the best ways to exercise since they help you relate side-to-side with your dog (which is extremely important to all canines). Other exercise forms would be fetching, a trip to the dog park, fetching up and down the stairs, or having your dog learn to ride a treadmill. I recommend at least a 30 minute walk twice a day for a barker (you can read about mastering the walk here).
Initial Level is just like it sounds, as well. Most games start the character off at level 1, but if for some reason you want to start your characters off at a higher level, the option is available for you. This is also a good option to have in the case of testing your game: the ability to choose what level your character is without having to play through hours of content just to test the new dungeon you implemented is great.
But with some CAMRA members there’s this sense of entitlement. It has nothing to do with head office having negotiated a commercial discount; it’s about this or that individual believing they deserve special treatment simply because they are a CAMRA member.

“Daughter, do you know why I wanted you to keep a ‘good things’ journal? It’s because that’s what my journal about you is like. If you were to read the story of your life, that’s what you would read. Not mistakes or failures, but the times you were a blessing, the ways you please me, the love you show others. The good things I think about you.”

2) “True love is like a metal tested in a fire. Fires of adversity surround us daily. Are we to love only when it is merely convenient? Like gold or silver, which very hot fire must heat to purge them of impurities, love must be thrust into the fire from time to time to make it purer, stronger and more resilient. And in the same way, love shines its brightest right out of the flames.”
So when we told Kevin we were the Couch to 5K team, what HE HEARD was Couch to Keg. And heck. Who were we to argue with such impeccable logic. We exercise so that we have room in our diet for a couple cocktails. That is just the honest fact of it.
I think it all breaks down to HOPE. Hope for better, Hope for one’s life led free from the frustration from it all. I can never get so bummed I just stop….give up.

There may well be, as this channel has experienced, a very deep sense of unknown sadness. And it is a sadness of what has occurred upon this planet, what has occurred in lifetime after lifetime with the devolution of the Plan. But that is all right, my beloved friends; let it go, because this will also be continued on by a sense of release. Many of you will want to rest, back to the time of being a child who needs a nap, or a child who needs a nap after they have had a good cry.
In the grand scheme of things, the workmanship is not the main reason why I bought the shirt (after all, a lot of companies do shirts well). It still comes back to the spirit in which MH designs her clothes, and that spirit comes across very well in her clothing. As long as this spirit holds true for me, I will happily justify her high prices and buy her clothes again when the right piece comes along.

I decided to start researching all I could online and through books and the scriptures and was amazed at what I found. My focus was on modesty. My focus for so many years has been on pleasing the world in my dress – with my hair, my clothes, and my makeup. I wanted to “fit in” and be trendy for such a long time, and I am ashamed to say that I followed many of the horrible trends of the past. I liked the attention from others – and found myself drawing farther away from my Heavenly Father as I focused more on the material of life and my own self than the spiritual and
I'm not a Super Crocheter but this really was a fairly easy to create. In fact, I was seriously debating whether to finish the rabbit or to possibly alter the original goal. Do you see it? No? Need a hint? I have this niece that is completely enamored with a little white kitten? Wouldn't this be adorable as a Hello Kitty basket? I'll have to put that on my to-do list for sure. :)

I can't remember if it was Steven Wright or Gallagher who posed the question, "Why does cargo go by boat, and shipment go by plane?" Regardless, I have a car, specifically a 1993 JEEP Grand Cherokee with broken overdrive clocking in at 257,000 miles, with five firkins of fine West Coast cask ale and three beer engines, along with all the other bits and pieces necessary to make it work such as rubber mallets, ice quilts and jackets. This is true and valuable cargo. Two of the casks are mine; the other three belong to the Eugene City Brewery (Rogue), Oakshire, and Block 15. I have spent the last month or so cultivating the myth that I will be taking their scrummy product to the 3rd Annual Firkin Fest at the Green Dragon in Portland, and that I can be trusted to treat them with the utmost care that they are due. Little do they know that I have a campsite out in the woods, a guitar, a stack of good books, a crate of Cheetos and a cooler full of frozen pizzas.

We mostly needed to figure out how our business was going to function before making anything for our presentation.
Although I received many books over the holidays I didn't take appropriate photographs, plus there were just so many, that I figured the best bet in discussing what books I had gotten was to start over again in the new year. My first week of mail when I returned home after the holidays was definitely a welcome batch of awesomeness that I look forward to reading.

We’ve gained quite a following over this past week! A few days ago, we kicked off a new category to cover for you: Movies, and luckily, it’s been greeted with some incredible feedback from the UDuelist community–thanks, by the way! In other news, the official release of the newest Yu-Gi-Oh! pack, Galactic Overlord, is released in a couple of days, so if you missed the preview event, you’ll have your chance at getting some of the most game-defining cards soon! IN any case, let’s get on with our Card of the Night tonight, shall we?

This is my first beaded necklace. The clasp is the kitten stretched out with the ball of yarn between its front paws. The charm is the kitten on its back with the ball of yarn between all four paws. The beads are long glass slender beads (much like tiny spaghetti beads) that are facet cut so they shine as if they were diamonds with little tiny clear seed beads in between them. The charm and clasp are silver.
I had seen this recipe on the web a couple month ago and I was dying for an excuse to make this! I invited some friends over for some hot tubing, wine and dinner and made this! This comes from Skinny Taste, one of my favorite healthy eating websites. She is a great resource for those of you who do weight watchers.
I have to admit, I'm really optimistic now. We hit a lot of delays with our home study for Caden's adoption as well, but once it was approved it was only seven months until I was boarding a plane for China! Once we receive our I800A approval (which takes 2-3 months on average), I can send our three dossier documents to the Secretary of State to be certified and then on to the Chinese Consulate to be authenticated. My key word for that stage of the process is "expedite" so all that should take less than 2 weeks. :) At that point our paperwork will all be sent to China and the real countdown to Cora can begin! We're currently about nine months away from travel based on the average timeframe for each step to be processed, but we're praying for speedy approvals!
I was advised to drink lots of water and take the iron tablets…. to try again in 2 weeks time … huhu!
As a foster parent of (pretty much all) special needs/handicapped pets; those calls are utilized much more than in a regular situation – and often times my decision is that of “let it go” – if it happens, it happens. Part of me applauds some of these animals for even making it so far as to be at my house; because if survival of the fittest hadn’t killed them by then, they have some serious angels in their corner.
As a working single parent, my days were already pretty full. I'm sure I don't need to convince you of this, cos you'll already know from your own experience. There simply aren't that many hours hanging around in my week doing nothing.
You know, enjoy the beauty.
Which brings me to my point. The united states of America (lower-cased for emphasis) aren't working. The umbrella that is our federal government is just not diverse and progressive enough to deal with the changing face of our vast country and the different regions within. The idea of 1,000 people representing nearly 400 million is absurd. Not to mention the fact that the majority of the members of congress are old white men, who are so out of touch with what is going on across this country that it's laughable to say they represent us at all. They're from a country where old white men rule, and they want to keep it that way. The uprising of women and minorities in this country is foreign to them, as are new ideas about relationships and protection of privacy and individual rights. They don't represent us anymore, and it's time we recognize that fact and move on.
However, there is a church service, a recognition that happens prior to Easter. Holy Week is filled with recognition of things that happened in that last week of Christ's life. Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter Sunday.

We'll be told how much money Hillary Clinton has raised, how Bill will give her a boost, and how great of a campaigner she is. Does she get the Democratic nomination? Watch the belt buckle. Hillary's negatives are over 50% in some polls. Even in the more favorable polls her "won't vote for her no matter what" numbers are in the high 30s. Essentially, she's juking and spinning, and she might spin down the field for a few yards. But she has little chance to get to the end zone.

there are things about "us" that are harder to handle. like when he is over-extraverted or when he is overtired or when he is uncomfortable, what he feels is so amplified, and I have a hard time calming him down or making him feel safe.

For the fourth or fifth time, I served as a graduation marshal, this time at the summer 2010 commencement ceremonies at Texas A&M University.

Nothing stays the same. Have I mentioned how very much I love the little grove by the church? Well, they cut down most of the trees. They only left the ones around the perimeter, but essentially, the grove is no longer. It's just an empty lot full of tree stumps. They took down the tire swing my son and his friend strung up with an old garden hose; in fact the tree it was hanging from is gone. I'm welling up with tears as I write this, as I did when I first saw it.
As the significance of all that had happened in less than a minute was being absorbed, a woman with a pre-school child, unaware of the events, walked onto the grounds and pointed out the Dr. Seuss sculptures. The child squealed with delight. A truck backed up to the grounds and people began unloading equipment for a musical performance by Joe Velez and Creacion that was scheduled to begin just a few hours after the shooting. One of the men unloading the truck whistled a lively tune.

If you are an on fire believer are you praying for this lost world and conforming yourself daily to be like Christ to the damned?
2) Character: Captain It is my villain and sie’s trans. Well not really. Sie’s sort of the opposite of trans. More transgressive than transgendered. I know I’m supposed to be infinitely compassionate for everyone pushed into the same boat as me, but I’m as factionated as anyone else. You wouldn’t believe the flame wars we used to have back in the 90′s on alt.support.srs and soc.support.transgender. This identity versus that. This belief versus that. This habit versus that. The newsgroups are where I learned the rules of internet engagement. Godwin’s law. Ad hominem attacks. The truth that the only way you know you’ve won is that the other side finally shuts up.

It is rather interesting at this time to compare the calling of Saul with that of Moses. For this we go back to Exodus 3:2-3.
However, there is a psychological theory called “Terror Management Theory” (TMT) that shows that when people are made aware of their own mortality, they become more punitive and aggressive towards others who could potentially threaten their world view and self-esteem. For example, judges are more likely to hand down harsher sentences if they have been reminded of their impending deaths.

Not THE first film I saw and enjoyed, but certainly the first film I fell in love with. I think I was 18 at the time and went to see it in a local cinema down the road from the flat I lived in. The cinema was called 'The Globe' on the corener of Welfield Road, in Roath, Cardiff. It was a shabby, run-down affair and I remember wearing my coat all the way through as it was freezing in there - even the walls glistened with damp. But it just made the experience of watching this film all the more amazing, as the cinema almost became a part of the film with its damp, cold atmosphere and tired, worn out decor blending in so well with that of the setting of the film. The final scene with Deckard and the last replicant, Roy Batty, was just so powerful for me there were no words to express my emotional state as a result.

This post is a little strange and hard to write. It's not even really a review, more just a tale about my experience with Victorian Disco Cosmetics. To cut a long story short, I had a really negative experience with the products I was sent for review. However, the owner Ashley has been really sweet and receptive to my feedback, and has already started overhauling some of the shades I had issues with. So while I'm about to detail the bad reaction I had to these shadows, I'm hoping the changes Ashley is implementing will ensure that nobody else has a similar experience to mine.

The Russian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church in America, which was renamed the Orthodox Church of America in 1970, declared itself autonomous at a time when the Russian Orthodox Church in Russia was experiencing serious persecution at the hands of the Bolshevik government and was struggling for its survival. In 1920 Patriarch Tikhon of Moscow directed all Russian Orthodox churches outside of Russia to govern themselves autonomously if the central administration were disabled or if they were unable to contact it. The ROGCCA declared itself autonomous without the necessary condition of the inability of the central administration to govern them. The Russian Orthodoc Church did not actually grant autocephaly to the OCA until 1970. All autocephalous Orthodox Churches , however, do not recognize the atocephaly of the OCA.

Not looking back with regret
There is absolutely nothing left to the imagination. Some scientists are looking for a cure for Alzheimer's and are testing on animals. They have a breakthrough and one of their test subjects, a chimp, becomes extremely bright, has a baby chimp who also has an intelligence on a par with a human for its age. People get scared, treat the chimp like shit, the chimp rebels with its chimp strength enhanced by its supercharged evolving brain and liberates the rest of the monkey world by turning the Human's Alzheimer's research against them.

Anyway, I had just learned to ride horses when the first spring show rolled around during my eighth grade year. I’d also become a proud horse owner thanks to my “second parents,” dear family friends who owned the farm right next to the school. Peaches and I had very little experience together as a team. She was young and considered “green,” or not at all well-trained. We were definitely not ready for a horse show, so I planned to watch and see what I could learn.

I have no clue what to make for supper tonight. What goes with hot whiskey? I am making lasagna for Christmas Eve. It's a tradition, though perhaps unintentional by my parents. They for some reason seemed to make something Italian for Christmas Eve dinner. Not because we're Italian in anyway. Maybe because it was easy to make? My kids like it, too, and I hardly throw together a lasagna on any other night, so I might as well make the most of it. As you know, finding anything that BOTH my children like at the same time, is a potshot in the dark.
Then we got back on the bikes and went to a second pagoda which I think was still in district 9. I don’t know the name of the pagoda either. From what I understood, this pagoda was built as an exact replica of a pagoda in Hanoi. This was done sometime after the unification of North and South Vietnam to symbolise the unity within Vietnam. I’ll also post pictures of this pagoda soon.
Overall, I'd say this novel was cute. Monsters are a huge trend in YA lit right now so it would make an okay addition to your collection.

As if me not watching this movie will turn such hate into make believe.
The middle ages to which Deanna travels is something of a deliberate caricature, with bumbling would-be-knights, a vain and mopish lady of the castle, pigs, greasy chunks of meat, etc. And Deanna and Oliver have no clue how to behave--the elves failed to provide lessons in castle etiquette for Deanna (although they did bestow the gift of medieval French), and Oliver, being a cat, is even more at sea. Over-the-top medieval romance complicates matters, but more seriously, the castle is home to a rather terrifying alchemist who has some genuine magical abilities, and naturally, he's the one who ends up with the watch...

That was an odd day. I had just visited my son's fourth grade class for an authors' party--the kids had written books about endangered animals. We walked around the classroom, read their stories, and signed their fan pages. On my son's page, I wrote that I was proud of him and that he could now say he was published before his mom. A half hour later I arrived home to find the email indicating my novel had been accepted. I jumped, screamed, ran around a bit, and hyperventilated. Later that night, a friend and I went to a book signing for Mary and Carol Higgins Clark. I told them the news and they were so excited for me. It was nice to see that they hadn't forgotten the thrill of that first acceptance.

This is something I’ve debated on and off with quite a few children’s authors. Some take a hard line and resist saying anything that could be construed as boasting. Others feel that Facebook, say, is there for the sharing of good news however big-headed it makes one look. One author I talked to this week resists social networking altogether, because she’s so careful of her public statements.
Historically, the core content of conservatism has always been a suspicion of government power and intervention and conservatives therefore accept only the minimum amount of government that seems needed for a civil society to function. So it is no wonder that there is no authoritarian version of conservative ideology. If it were authoritarian it could not be conservative.

When we arrived at our destination the entire staff were out front, ticket staff up to senior management all trying to help us get to our onward destinations and up front the Manager of the station doing the big bow, apologising to us for the inconvenience, not his fault, but he still felt he needed as an honourable person to apologise..
I'll illustrate what I'm talking about with a couple of examples - on Saturday a woman turned up wearing a jacket with a fox head on the hood and a tail on the back. Like, from an actual literal dead fox. To a huntsab benefit. There were people there who have dedicated their lives to stopping bloodsports, and she just blithely turned up like it wouldn't be a problem - even going so far as to act offended when people told her that it was sick, and claim that she was being 'attacked'. I mean, what the fucking fuck did she expect? Everyone to coo and tell her how lovely it was?

Comfort in the Day -The believers at Thessalonica had a measure of knowledge concerning the end times. However, that portion had led them to believe that the dead were at a disadvantage at Christ’s return compared to those who were living. It is unclear whether they believed that those who died before Christ’s return forfeited resurrection completely or that they merely would miss out on the event itself. It is clear, however, that their eschatology was deficient and that, through correcting it, Paul sought to provide them with comfort in their sorrows and sufferings.

I had a bazillion things to do today before we could go to my significant other's great niece's 2nd birthday party. And somehow the tree decorating didn't happen. I need to find one of those light connector things that you can feed through the tree to connect all of your lights to because our other one was broken when we got it out to use it. We've had it so long that I don't even know if they make them any longer. I'll look for it after work tomorrow. Then I can get the tree decorated. I guess that means I can leave it up longer after the holidays 'cause it's taken me so long to get it decorated. Works for me. All the other decorations are finally finished. Finally...

In addition to doing pot lights in the ceiling we're doing under cabinet lights. We have them right now in our kitchen and I couldn't go a day without using them. But they weren't here when we moved in - we simple installed some Ikea plug in puck lights.

Attachment to the idea of what a love relationship should be like is probably why they so often fail. What should always be the goal of both persons is to keep the connection. Allowing a person to his own mistakes, giving them the freedom to come and go and trusting your ability to deal with it if they choose the later is the most important aspects of non attachment you can practice. Meanwhile keeping a healthy dose of the same connection to your own soul so that you know when behaviour is at the extreme and unhealthy end of the spectrum. You can love a person and not want to live with their destructive behaviour. You can love a person and not want them as part of your life. This is perfectly fine and in fact, vital.

According to Chen’s friend (and Chinese human rights advocate) Bob Fu, Chen escaped from house arrest by climbing over a wall behind his house.

Chen had to navigate blindly both the back wall of his property and a small army of as many as 90 Communist guards, falling more than 200 times in the process,yet persevering to his victorious escape. In his triumph, Chen has done more than embarrass the Communist government, he has exposed it.
Two women and two or three men came aboard. They went back and forth, looking at everything they could see. Then the old man came up to me and asked my name and age. I told him, even though I was almost too scared to speak. After that, a woman came over. They admired my hair. We all black hair, she said. I was wearing a red skirt. They admired red and wanted so much to have it. I knew they were hungry, so I invited them to have some pea soup I had cooked. They couldn't stay long because it was too hot for them. They brought a pair of beaded slippers and a little purse made of sealskin, which they wanted to exchange for some clothes. I looked among my clothes and gave them all I could spare. I really enjoyed my fur slippers and have never seen a pair like it since. The first of July when we left home it was a beautiful day. We planned to have fish and brewis for supper. When we were coming in to Seldom the wind changed and the schooner listed on her side. The pot with the fish and brewis came off the stove and over the floor. I didn't cook under sail anymore. I was too seasick for that. We got caught in a terrible storm that came on suddenly. I was down in the forecastle and couldn't get back to the cabin where I used to stay under sail. The storm didn't feel so bad back there. However, I climbed up in the top bunk and held on for dear life. Every time she took a nose-dive, water came into the forecastle. It took two men pumping constantly to keep the water out. Every man did his best to get back to land. Every now and then I heard someone shout to ask someone to check on me to see if I was still alive. We had been out in some high winds and heavy seas, but that storm was the worst. The Polly Bee was very old. She had no engine and they had to depend on the wind. When it came the wrong way it would be tough going, and when it was calm, sails were no good.

Like the Nature Conservancy, the National Park Service wishes to recreate a pre-Columbian scene. However its mandate, as stated in the General Management Plan, is not simply to restore wilderness, but to open it for the pleasure of human visitors (National Park Service 1985, pp. 81 and 82). This mandate is flawed by an internal contradiction, because humans of European descent are, of course, as much an anachronism as sheep and pigs in a pre-Columbian landscape. Nonetheless, the Park Service, in accordance with its charge, has constructed camp grounds and hiking trails and encourages people to enjoy the experience of placing themselves in a scene which approximates the pristine wilderness of an earlier period. Ironically it has also left standing structures built by the ranchers, in order to retain the “historic scene” of the ranching era, but without the ranch animals (National Park Service 1985, pp. 36, 37, 41, 44 and 45). The projected increase in annual human visitors to the Island will contribute to the degradation of the land and adjacent ocean water. The Park Service has no tolerance, however, for other non-native species, and had planned to shoot the feral sheep, pigs and horses once it took possession of the east end.

When I read this I thought of the many, many hours I spent standing beside my father in our garage handing him spanners and hammers and tools with daft names like torque wrench and needle-nose pliers. My dad was a proper dad; a dad that worked with his hands; a dad who’d started “in t’mill” (remember he was a Lancashire lad) when he was something like thirteen and never had a day off discounting his National Service and a few weeks following his heart attack (probably caused by overwork). Before I read this story I had no idea what a saw set was but I bet my dad had one. He had all kinds of saws. He wasn’t a joiner by trade but he’d have a crack at anything: bricklaying, plumbing, electrics, you name it. I can change a plug and I can change a tyre but that’s about my limit.
And a setpiece doesn’t have to cost millions or tens of millions of dollars, either, although as authors, we have the incredible advantage of an unlimited production budget. Did you authors all get that? We have an UNLIMITED PRODUCTION BUDGET. Whatever settings, crowds, mechanical devices, alien attacks or natural disasters we choose to depict, our only budget constraint is in our imaginations. The most powerful directors in Hollywood would KILL for a fraction of our power. Theoretically, they can’t even begin to compete.

Another common discussion topic was welcoming "the minorities withing the minority", as one person put it. Welcoming those from different ethnic backgrounds, those with different sexual orientations, different economic backgrounds... Another thing that the part of the unschooling community that goes to conferences (and this is a big point. I think there is far more diversity in the greater unschooling community, just not so much in the group that shows up to conferences) really needs to do is recognize that it is really not a very diverse group. The great majority of conference attendees are white and middle class, and I'm rather embarrassed that this fact didn't make more of an impression on me when I first started attending unschooling gatherings (though admittedly I haven't attended very many!). I have Erika Davis-Pitre to thank for that. She has so many important things to say on a variety of topics, and such wonderful insights. I enjoyed every talk of hers I attended and every conversation with her I had!

When you are writing on your bags the cooking instructions and the date frozen you want to make sure you are using a PERMANENT marker.

This is a fair and honest statement, but ‘cutting out the distributor’ simply means that Domtom, like many author solution companies, do not have a book distributor in place beyond the normal book data listings provided to online retailers and book wholesalers such as Gardners in the UK. Having a dedicated sales team of representatives to sell your catalogue of books to high street stores is not something you decide to ‘cut out’. Domtom Publishing’s strategy is to rely on in-house direct marketing, but again, they need to clearly show to perspective authors how exactly this forms part of their business and the self-publishing services they offer.
Thanks for tuning in. Writing is cathartic for me. I don’t have a lot of people to really talk to on a daily basis. It doesn’t help to not have a vehicle or a reliable source of income; I can text a bit, but it’s difficult to make plans. I was never one for spending money, but now it’s kind of a necessity to save more than usual.

The final point of synthesis relates to the typological nature of circumcision. Regardless of what any others might say it seems consistent within the biblical text to connect circumcision with regeneration. This is most obvious in Colossians 2:11-12 where spiritual circumcision and regeneration is connected to baptism as opposed to physical circumcision. One interesting implication of this would be the relationship between the sealing aspect of Abrahams circumcision in Romans 4:9-11 and the sealing role of the Holy Spirit in other parts of the NT (Eph. 1:13; 4:30, 2 Cor. 1:22). Yet, such a connection would be difficult to prove based on a passing statement of Paul’s. It’s clear that the sealing role of circumcision for Abraham was quite different from that of the Holy Spirit so the relationship is somewhat ambiguous. Of course, the crucial distinction to be made is the nature of the type in physical circumcision and it’s fulfillment in the antitype of regeneration and increased freedom from sin. Regarding such a relationship Justin Martyr said: “

They were just walking out of the cafe as it happened, Chris (Mrs) pushed her husband hard out of the way of falling debri, he still didn't have the strength to move at any pace. He was knocked to the ground by part of a falling building and she threw herself over top of him to protect him from anything else coming down. When the dust cleared she noticed that he was bleeding out from his leg, she ripped off her top and tried to tourniquet his thigh, it wouldn't work, he fell unconcious. A couple of people tried CPR but he didn't recover and a policeman told them they had to leave. Chris (Mrs) punched the policeman in despair, how could he think she could leave her still warm husband there?? She had no choice, a shop assistant covered his body with a curtain, Chris (Mrs) took his wallet from his pants, she couldn't bear to think of people going through it, and she wrote his name and details on the curtain ---- and left her soulmate.
It seems like this week has just been testing, testing, and more testing! That is one thing that I definitely miss about 1st grade, just put the grades into the computer, and ta-dow!!! Here's an average!! This individual testing is a bummer!! It seems as if all day today and yesterday I was calling names and saying ,"come to my table, come to my table, come to my table". Not to mention the math common assessment!! Which is also individual! And of course we also had a walk-through, and they came to my room after my kiddos had been gone for an hour and a half. Can you imagine teaching math to 5-year olds after lunch, PE, and then music? Whew! I am determined to have some St. Patrick's Day fun the rest of this week. I've been getting my things together, because my kiddos are definitely ready for Spring Break, and you can tell by their behavior!!

- Shift your focus off of self-condemnation. When our conscience relentlessly condemns us, remember that Christ will have the last word. He is judge of the living and the dead (1 Peter 4:5) and only he can pronounce the final sentence. Christ is the judge — not us or our conscience. So never for a moment dare to take the judge’s place by proclaiming irreparable guilt when he proclaims hope, grace, and pardon. If we think our sin is too great to be pardoned, remember that Christ doesn’t agree.

Some might call Pink a gold-digger, but not me. I too would prefer to put my time and energy into someone with a secure bank account; the point being that money isn’t all that matters to me. Nor is it all that matters to Pink. She’s simply a woman confident enough in her self-worth to demand the best, and while she has little money of her own, minimal social position and average looks, she’s also too smart and determined to be denied.

Today we start from Museo di San Marco. The museum occupies the oldest part of the Dominican convent, rebuilt by Michelozzo between 1436-1446. Friar Giovanni da Fiesole, known as Fra Angelico, lived in the convent first in 1387 and then from 1400 to 1455. During those years he enriched the building with a cycle of paintings. The name “Angelico” came from the grace of the friar’s brushstroke, but also from his goodness: the Church, in fact, declared him Beato (Beatus) in 1982. You can start your visit from the chiostro (cloister) and the loggia. Right at the entrance you are introduced to Fra Angelico’s first fresco: San Domenico adoration of the crucifix. Enter the Ospizio dei Pellegrini ( Pilgrim’s hospice) and admire Fra Angelico’s painted work on wooden panels. The colors are just magnificent and so is the use of the perspective, visible even in the small format’s panels. The Sala Capitolare (Chapter Hall) houses the Crucifixion. These are all beautiful works; nothing, however, could prepare you to the view that expects you at the corner of the first flight of stairs leading to the cells: The Annunciazione (Annunciation), just breathtaking! I was personally in awe . . . I cannot even describe it.
In a few hours, I’ll be going to the funeral of one of my heroes. My grandpa, who my cousins and I all call Pepere, passed away earlier this week. The picture above was taken in the late 1940′s, presumably in Winnipeg. When it was taken, he would have only had one or two of his 11 children. We are a large French Canadian family; there are 30 grandchildren, (I have many cousins!!), and 35 great grandchildren.

And then you take a step in, and you notice the wiggling fish in a basket on the street, where an old lady sits waiting to make a sale.

You walk into a temple where incense is burning.

At the end of August, I entered the final phase of a chapter of my life; the chapter of being a University/ College student. Even during the summer before I entered this phase, I was having difficulties conveying my feelings. The only way I know how to truly release my frustrations and feelings is through listening and relating to music and this blog. So, today I wanted to discuss some songs that have inspired and moved me recently, most of them being Tegomassu songs.
But you and me are easy meat to track.

The restaurant was designed so that the ice cream was displayed at the entrance (ala Baskin Robbins) and the fountain boy was in full display in his white shirt, black pants, red paisley vest, and the, always stylish, red white and blue paper hat (Gandhi style). The job required showmanship, artistry, speed, and an incredibly strong wrist and forearm. I loved it! Especially Friday nights as the local high school football games ended and we were overrun with ice cream loving teenagers. Showtime! Tom Cruise had nothing on me (well, except for the looks and Nicole Kidman).
Also released shortly is a Hollywood version of Edge of Darkness, which older people may remember as a brilliant UK television series from the 1980s. Sadly this new version stars Mel Gibson, an actor in whom I have lost a lot of faith over the years and early reports don’t sound promising as for starters the ending has been changed. There is still a temptation to see the film, although I think buying the box set of the original series and re-watching that is probably the better bet.

It was a relatively simple refashioning, but one that I'm proud of for its subtlety and craftsmanship. Unfortunately, I didn't think to take a "before" picture. When I purchased this lavender top, it was a short dress with kangaroo pockets that seemed awkwardly incongruous with the delicacy of the lace. I only wore it as a nighty, partially because it was so soft, but mainly because I couldn't find a way to style it that would satisfy my personal standards. Then when I laundered it, it shrunk a good 4", also sending the kangaroo pockets off-grain (a common problem with cheap factory-produced garments, as they're often cut off-grain in order to save fabric and costs). So to start with, I carefully removed the kangaroo pockets and further shortened and evened-out the hem so that the off-grain-ness is only noticeable by me (I think).

Hey Crafty Bloggers,
If you have a child who has allergies, sensitivities, or reacts behaviorally to certain food additives then you may feel you have to control what your child eats. Unless the allergy is life threatening, letting go of control and respectfully providing your child with information is still an option. And if the allergy is life threatening, being respectful of your child when you need to protect them should be your focus. Children do not want to feel sick any more than an adult. If they are given the opportunity to see how foods affect them and are supported in making their own choices they will almost always end up choosing not to eat the food that is problematic, or will eat it mindful of the potential negative effects.

The second opinion is Elektra Entertainment Group, Inc. v. Denise (sic) Barker, Case No. 05-CV-7340 (S.D.N.Y. March 31), an opinion by Judge Kenneth Karas. The opinion was issued on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim; the issue therefore was whether the claim satisfied the Rule 8 pleading requirements. The court first held that the complaint adequately alleged defendant had used a P2P network, and that plaintiff had alleged, “Defendant did distribute (and/or made available) Plaintiff’s protected works. This is sufficient under Rule 8.” Nor did Defendant seem to contest that point; rather she argued that she was not liable “merely by making the copyrighted recordings available. In particular, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs cannot establish a violation of their distribution rights without alleging an actual transfer of Plaintiff’s works by Defendant.”

Well, we ruled out trauma because your daughter hasn’t experienced anything like that . And the culprit are the vaccines just as you had suspected. Doc continues telling you that your daughter is exhibiting ghost like symptoms of TB and you can only sit back and be angry. Angry because you were lied to. Angry at yourself for not having listened to what your gut instinct was telling you back then. You knew before you even gave her one single shot that there was something not right about giving a very healthy baby a disease to prevent her from getting the disease later on. Then you asked people whom you thought wiser than you for advise and they just told you the same thing: “ Give her the shots because you never know what can happen later if you don’t.” So you stop listening to that inner voice and agree to it because you’re a new mother who wants the best for her child and you go against your God-given gut instinct and allow her to be poked in her arm with TB.

One more thought for now. Where are places you can give something away FREE that will raise interest in you and your book? Consider this: If you have created an e-book, once the basic production cost has been paid, it costs basically nothing to send out beyond a little computer time. Think about finding places you could offer your e-book FREE to anyone who writes to request it. Consider law enforcement people and other first-responders; how about a gift for any and every military service person; missionaries and helps missions around the world? How many might love to read a free e-book, then tell a friend or buy your hardback? Consider clubs, companies and organizations that might offer your e-book at their next annual meeting or corporate fundraiser. If you’re going to pay for some kind of advertising, why not “pay” by sending out a FREE copy of your e-book so the word will spread?

The cinematography is an absolute pleasure here, and that is forever to be expected from Academy Award winning director of photography Dean Cundey. In the opening minutes of the film, we are given stunning shots of the immense arctic landscape that clearly establish how isolated our characters are. The photography can even prove to be terribly creepy at times such as the storage room scene after MacReady breaks into the compound. Kurt Russell looks ghostly with the brilliant blue lighting upon his snow covered self. Cinematography in a Carpenter film has always been a strong point, and you cannot deny its strength here. It helps evoke the proper emotions at the right times by capturing atmosphere in its compositions and lighting. Another such element is Ennio Morricone’s score. Right from the get go, it sets the tone for the entire film. It grips you and never lets go. This score is haunting, relentless, brooding, and terribly chilling. This is such a powerful score, and despite that Carpenter did not compose it, it does have many elements of his own scores in it. Morricone had scored many “spaghetti” westerns including The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly, and we would later score The Untouchables. To this day, Morricone continues to score many films, mostly Italian ones.

Rel's footsteps scuffed back from the darkness ahead as drawn-out, bloated whispers. Lack of a breeze made the air lifeless despite a chill that was oddly soothing. It took the worst of the sting from his developing headache. Here and there, water glistened with reflected gloom, running silently down the walls. It was all Rel could do not to hold his breath.

After writing and posting this article this morning, I had a “stumble upon” experience, or what I prefer to call a God leading. I saw copy of Time magazine in an office and picked it up. It contained an article about Nones.
The one big change in the syllabus is that I'm replacing Petals of Blood with The River Between. There was really no choice; A Sentimental Education and Burger's Daughter are both pretty long and complex, so following them with the long complexities of Petals of Blood was just too much for the students, though they gave it a good shot. I should probably just do a whole course of those three books, but I like having a couple shorter books in there, too. So Petals of Blood had to go. River Between is fine, but it's simpler and not as perfect for our theme of "revolution", so I'm definitely disappointed. If the term were even just one week longer, we'd still be able to fit Petals of Blood in, but I just couldn't make it work with the current schedule. We may not even get to do River Between — just last week, the campus bookstore let me know they can't get copies from their distributor because the book is effectively out of print. It's still perfectly available via Amazon, Barnes & Noble, etc., so I'm going to see if the students are willing to order copies themselves (if they haven't done so already). If not, we'll have to drop it.
Dianne and Lee decide to fly to Virginia where they encounter a city still reeling from the emotional impact of the shooting and distrustful of outsiders who won’t allow them to forget. Following leads withheld from the police and FBI, they quickly learn everything is not as it’s been reported in the news. The mysterious numbers are connected to even more crimes, the school shooter was not working alone, and he left behind a suicide note that simply read…I’m not finished yet! Lee and Dianne had somehow stumbled across the wizard behind the curtain, and the Knights weren’t in Kansas anymore. Now the group had a choice to make, return home and pass up a chance to clear their friend’s name, or put their very lives in danger by going toe to toe with an unimaginable fiend.

Those that remain at the club are focussing on finishing the season by winning the remaining games. All the while the original Franchise FC – credit to the AISA History booklets by Tony Attwood and Andy Kelly for observing that Chelsea were formed specifically to play in the Football League and have no history prior to this – are in the Champions League, third place is the only position that guarantees Champions League football; it would be a tense night for the fourth placed side were Chelsea to continue with their recent run of good form in the Camp Nou.

My husband loves honey-do lists–the longer the list, the more satisfied he feels when each item has a bold hash mark through it. Mow the lawn. Done. Change the light fixtures. All set. Pay the bills. Taken care of. Despite Dave’s affinity for these lists, I have never given him one. Even more than that, I’m careful not to mention things that need to be taken care of around the house because–like Santa’s list– they’ll be added to the queue.
Truly, that was a day that we will never forget...nor should we. It serves as a reminder that life can change at any minute, that although a day may dawn normally, it may change in a heartbeat.

Step 5 - Blend your colours together with your lighter skin tone (E50 here). Now for blush, you can either tip-to-tip or use the palette blending technique. I chose to scribble some R20 onto the bottom of my acetate since it was already on my desk and then picked up the colour with my E51 Marker. I chose the darker one because I wanted rosy cheeks - but I will often do it with the lighter skin tone (E50) - depends on the image you are using.
Bogie and Bacall’s final film together was John Huston’s atmospheric thriller Key Largo, in 1948. This film featured Bacall’s most relaxed wardrobe to date, and she looks the picture of laid-back elegance in this simple ensemble.
Ideas alone cannot have any effect. They are simply information and evil people know this. That is why conditions are set up in the physical world to empower those ideas and hence trick the other person into believing them. And let me specify here again that empowered ideas are not ones that the evil people can present as some potent weapon being thrown at the victim from them. Evil people have no mental powers. Empowered ideas only means that lame ideas are presented at such time and in such a way as to find fertile soil. The victim is upholding beliefs together with changes to their body function, which occur simultaneously with the ideas presented, so as to make those ideas appear as powerful ideas. They are not. It is all about deceit and really a dramatic puppet show stitched together, a cut and paste exercise. With this in mind we can then appreciate that to generate barrier or resistance cells in the body (what doctors call cancer cells) there needs to be harmful ideas presented in the mind that are empowered because of the condition of the targeted person/ the victim; and for all that to occur when the targeted person is angry and hostile. When a person is angry and hostile they will hold a misguided volition with respect to those ideas as to struggle with them. However finding no clear and definable aggressor with which to struggle, which is their plan A, they go to plan B. In Plan B their volition becomes the desire to build a barrier or shield for protection against the mysterious aggressor. The theatre of war seems to be in the body, so the barrier that can be built can only ever be a cell barrier, which of course grow bigger and bigger the harder they struggle and fight until a mass is formed. This mass doctors call cancer.
Yesterday morning, we finished up our coloring books about the parable of the prodigal son. As the last crayon strokes were being applied, I asked Beanie and Bugaboo what they thought made the father in the story so happy. Both of them replied the father had thought his younger son was dead, but when he showed up alive, he was so happy he threw a huge party to celebrate. Their wee brows furrowed as I explained to them the father was certainly relieved to see his younger son safely home, but his real joy was in the young man’s loving repentance, and realization that his pursuit of all earthly delights had led him to ruin. The father, I went on to explain, was wild with joy that his son had returned with a wish to work hard and live uprightly.

A bill tying judges and counties hands on the cheapest way to handle low-level bail bonds has cleared the Senate and already received a hearing in the House, putting at risk successful systems used in multiple jurisdictions. Tuesday, the House Criminal Jurisprudence Committee heard SB 878 which would disallow courts from accepting cash bonds less than the full amount pending pretrial release. In other words, the bail bond industry wants a monopoly. They want to force people to choose between coming up with the full amount in cash or paying 10-15% to a bail bondsman that they'll never see again. I happened to be in the committee hearing when this was heard and thought it was a terrible bill; having now read it, I'm convinced that's the case.

We all want to rant and rave and use statistics against the traditional publishing beast as we know it, but kicking it from one end of the street to the other might give us a temporary sense of empowerment and vent our frustrations against the gatekeepers of the beast, but whether we like it or not, we are only going to fix publishing by becoming a part of it. It is time we forgot about the cosmetics of labels like ‘indie’ and championing personal platforms and commercial interests. If ASI really wants to do something constructive, then they should look to fully empowering their authors to do what Seth Godin and Joe Konrath do – let your authors take full control – provide them with a service that makes them own their ISBN and imprint name. Provide them with real distribution channels to high street bookstores. Strike a deal that offers your publishing engine to one of the big six publishing houses. And for the love of god, drop the ‘Achieve your dreams’ talk. I’d like to think that kind of sell is something for the true vanity presses.

I'm not sure exactly when journalism went down the tubes, but there are really no news sources available anymore that provide just information and let the viewer sort it out. Ironically, the closest we have is Rachel Maddow, whose reporting does tend to lean left, but who is always inviting those who disagree with her onto her show to sort things out -- and they almost always refuse, because they know that if they're wrong, Maddow will demonstrate that they're wrong using facts instead of appeals to the reptilian brain.

The Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God, and these readings this week which round up the space between the nativity and the epiphany, teach us about dependence.

Mr. Hitchens argues that the Bible is wicked because it contains violence, an odd concern from someone who supports bombing everything in the Middle East, probably including Israel. The argument is that the God of the Bible cannot be great because he himself sometimes destroys people in both the Old and New Testaments. According to Hitchens, the God of the Bible would be wicked, if he existed.
So then when I was trying to straighten her out not long after we got there she stepped in a huge cow patty that had a whole colony of ANTS in it!

The basic outlines of the new system are as follows: The US dollars owned by people outside of the US (and those created before 2008 in the US) will be backed by gold and a basket of commodities and other currencies. This will then become the international dollar (or perhaps international yen or yuan) and be used to facilitate world trade. The Euro will be split into a fortified Deutschemark shared by Northern countries while the Mediterranean countries will revert to their traditional currencies and devalue them until their real economies are competitive enough. This will be followed by a one off massive debt write off.

My contention is that with a more traditional style of architecture it would look even more impressive. The individual buildings often make use of fine geometrical shapes and the Lowry Gallery has semi circles . In themselves these geometric shapes are attractive but they bear no relation to the inspiration for the building nor its function. If you walk through a historic town like Shrewsbury you have the finest Tudor street in England. When you turn the corner you come upon different periods but they are united and in harmony. Contemporary buildings are individual and not in harmony with their neighbours.
But, a difficult period featuring draws against Malaga, Villarreal and Valencia helped the Catalans back in the title hunt as they closed the gap to just four points at the top.

The new album was titled Persuasion and following the rejection of the album by MCA, Adam, together with a new band including Marco Pirroni, embarked on the live 1993 Persuasion Tour to attract a new label for the album. Ant was able to sign to new label Capitol Records in the USA and EMI in the UK, but MCA pulled a pissy pants move and was unwilling to let go of the Persuasion master tapes and so a new album Wonderful was recorded instead with the band from the tour. The album has surfaced as bootlegs and once in a while shows up in fan forums. This album is one of the 20 written about in "The Greatest Music Never Sold" by Dan Leroy, a book that reveals information on the legendary lost recordings of many famous artists. The latest news that I've found is that Sony now has the rights to the recordings, although nothing has been said yet with regards to releasing it. I picked this up from a fan site 7 or 8 years ago and as I was searching for the site again I found it's no longer in existence. I wouldn't call it his best work but there are moments of the Ant brilliance. So here is a couple cuts from the lost album and if anyone has been searching for it can drop me an email.
It was an uncommonly auspicious start to Morgan's career--a great Western for the great William Wellman, playing his best scenes with Fonda, in the same cast with character actors like Jane Darwell and Henry Davenport. With the benefit of hindsight, you can look at this scene and see a gift that was going to mark Harry Morgan's acting, whether he was wordlessly menacing in The Big Clock, having his cozy assumptions worn away in Inherit the Wind, or, year after year, trying to fight insanity armed only with common sense in M*A*S*H.
PP is now offering underaged girls lawyers so they can get secret abortions? Who's paying for that? It would be nice to know that no taxpayer dollars are going into that kitty. As the parent of two daughters, this enrages me. This movement to help our underaged daughters obtain abortions in secret has to stop. As mentioned above, these surgical procedures bring risks because they're surgical procedures. If nothing else, parents need to be notified so they can care for their daughter on a medical level, not to mention the many emotional issues she might experience. The problem is, notifying the parent would give them the opportunity to talk to their child and help her make an informed decision. Yes, they might be angry. Maybe disappointed. Definitely sad. But for the majority of parents faced with this dilemma, the health and well being of their daughter outweighs it all and they help and support her.

I’ve been surprised to see the issues of gluttony, sloth, and self-discipline show up over and over again in the stories of Christians. It all started when we were reading the story of John Wycliffe, and his detractors mocked him for being a glutton. I was first struck by the fact that we rarely hear that charge in American culture. It’s a sin we just don’t discuss. I was next surprised to realize that Wycliffe was rail-thin. He must have possessed a great metabolism, because he could eat. Gluttony (in food, drink, or any other area) is an issue that history treats rather matter-of-factly. So does the Bible. (Remember the story of Ehud in Judges 3? Yep, no punches pulled there. )
What's a sheriffs' department to do when everyone wants to attend an execution, but only two tickets are available? "What we always do," proclaims the hot pants-sporting Lt. Dangle. "Scavenger hunt!" And so it goes, as the officers track down such specific perps as a crackhead with a wig ("easy!"), and someone with a tattoo (bonus points if they are also Jewish). It's a cutthroat fight to the finish, because as redneck Deputy Junior enthuses, "Getting two tickets to an execution is like getting two tickets to NASCAR, except you know Jeff Gordon's gonna die!"

Moving on to aerodynamics, the text takes a simplistic approach to explaining aero, but there is an interesting illustration of the cars downforce distribution front to rear. This does highlight the downforce created by the wings and diffuser, but also the kick in downforce at the leading edge of the floor, but this is not adequately explained in the text. Mention is made of the front wing and the flexing that RBR deny, this is explained with a simple illustration showing the deflection test. The driver adjustable front flap, which was legal during 2009-2010 seasons, is explained, in particular that the wing was hydraulically actuated. When I understood that in 2009, only Toyota used a hydraulic mechanism over the electric motor system used by all other teams.

He managed a whopping 46 games at 39 years of age before he was discarded by the management.

Art or Idiocy? was in Cleveland this past weekend and had a chance to visit two of the city’s art venues. First was the Cleveland Museum of Art, which is partially closed for a major renovation and addition. The project is more drastic and expansive than Chicago’s Art Institute. As a result, many galleries of it’s encyclopedic permanent collection have been closed and deinstalled, with the museum’s total closure for a temporary period coming later this year. But what is currently on view is amazing. The NEO show, akin to the Greater New York, and the extinct Chicago and Vicinity exhibitions, highlights contemporary work from northeast Ohio. Also there is an exhibition of meticulous works on paper by Belgian artist Michaël Borremans. It is his first museum show and the CMA venue is its only stop in America. Borremans’ Hallucination and Reality is quite the sleeper hit.

You are so driven. That can be a blessing and a curse:) You set a goal and then work to pass it. You are super motivated. This is a huge blessing to me, but it is also something I worry about. You are so determined to to be your best, that the times you are not your best, you are SO hard on yourself. Much harder than your Abba and I would ever be. I pray every single day that you would understand that our love, and God's love, is not connected to how happy you make us or how disappointed we are. You were loved before you did a thing and you will be loved no matter what you do. I pray every single day, multiple times a day, that that truth will sink in. Being so driven is a wonderful thing, but my hope is that you know that you are loved completely no matter what you accomplish.

So that’s several lessons shared there already! Get internet savvy, know everything there is to now about publishing and marketing yourself, about how to sell yourself and your books.

Australia is a nation with a variety of education services to cater for a large influx of migrants. Australia realized the need to help and offered many basic programs, including adult education services. Out of those countries where citizens were not able to access a better education, Sudan is one of the severely affected nations.

An alert Writer Beware reader recently let me know that someone calling himself J.G. Goodman has posted some unflattering comments about me and fellow scam-buster Dave Kuzminski in the forums at SFReader.com, a speculative fiction-oriented website. Searching on a few key phrases quickly located a practically identical screed from a John Goodman on Written Road, a publishing-and-writing-oriented blog. By chance, I'd also seen an earlier negative comment about me from one Dave King on the Rumor Mill, a message board for writers sponsored by the ezine Speculations (you have to scroll down a bit; it's Message 483801). I might have assumed that it was unrelated to Mr. Goodman's rantings, had not ol' Dave written me the following "neener, neener" email:

School has not turned out to be as wonderful as I had hoped and I am contemplating another place to continue school. I am only in the 2nd quarter of school at the place I am going and am already so disappointed and dissatisfied that it pains me to go every day (I know, melodramatic). I was so excited to be back in school and to learn new things and meet new people and challenge myself.....blah, blah, blah....

It is also evident that employers have repackaged or are ‘converting’ or ‘rebranding’ existing jobs as apprenticeships so as to meet targets and qualify for money. Neither is it clear how many of them may be short-term – maybe for a few months at best. Under the Coalition many ‘apprenticeships’ exist in name only and are certainly not the legally binding indentures of yesteryear that guaranteed employment on completion because again, employers, benefiting from plenty of applicants, including plenty of graduates, do not require such ‘time serving.’ The reality is that most do not require apprentices at all!

That’s not what I saw, however, when I took an admittedly cursory look at politics in Mali several years ago, while making data for a research project on transitions to and from democracy. At the time, I saw legislative elections in early 1997 that had been plagued by serious flaws, and many of the accounts I read implicated members of the leading Alliance for Democracy in Mali (ADEMA) party in the discovered instances of electoral misconduct. Under an agreement between the incumbent president Alfred Konare and several opposition leaders, the Constitutional Court annulled the results later that month, but the court refused to reschedule the presidential contest, and Konare cruised to re-election with nearly 96 percent of the vote when the opposition boycotted. Meanwhile, Amnesty International reported that dozens of members and supporters of the opposition had been arrested ahead of the elections, and some were allegedly tortured. When legislative elections were re-run later in 1997, Konare’s allies won a large majority of seats, effectively consolidating the ruling party’s grip on power by questionable means.

To add insult to injury, Hanif is now heading the investigation panel raising doubts about the integrity, reliability and credibility of its findings. As a former Inspector-General of Police, Hanif is first and foremost disqualified from serving on the investigation panel due to this conflict of interest as the police is being accused. Secondly, by publicly condemning Bersih, Hanif’s prejudiced bias would also disqualify him to serve on the investigation panel. Finally, by linking Bersih to communism, Hanif is still fighting yesterday’s long-concluded wars, making the outcome of these investigations a foregone conclusion.

Fast paced, with mystery about Ben's past, romantic entanglements, totally loony killers from a hidden Catholic sect and a corrupt Archbishop. The book reads like it was originally a Hollywood screen play, gates "breaking like Balsa wood", glass shattering around him... etc. It is ok if you want a fast paced thriller which as little believability ... however Mr Mariani claims at the end that this is all well researched. Maybe on the key points of the story but then it is let down by poor research and other non believable stuff. We're told Mr Hope only ever deals in cash which he gets from a safe deposit box... once... but he buys a car, a motorbike, rents numerous hotel suites and villas etc. all I can say is Mr Hope must have a jacket with bloody big pockets! Also sadly for a real nitpickity sod like me a Citroen 2CV car is made an unlikely hero in a scene involving a level crossing... the 2CV is mortally wounded in this encounter as we're told the water is pouring from it's radiator... funny 2CV only ones I've ever seen were air cooled!

My pal Emily is an Annie fan. Remember Annie? Yeah, Ben's childhood sweetheart with the weird wooden dolls. She's adorable and Ben likes her so WE should like her. Anyways, I forget how we got on the subject (like I could ever rationalize what makes me draw the ridiculous crap that I do) but the idea crossed our minds that I draw young Ben sandwiched between Annie and Emily's younger self. Because young Ben is adorable and awkward.

So yeah, that’s the first 6 Hellraiser movies. It’s been a wild, crazy, stupid, ridiculous ride and I am glad it’s over. The thing with all of these movies is, they all had potential. Doug Bradley always seemed to be into what he was doing and the stories were all intriguing on paper, but the execution was just SO POOR that it completely ruined any chance of them being enjoyable. I really like a good occult horror movie, but none of these movies were good! They were all either dull, ridiculous or both. I’ve never seen a franchise with so much potential screw up everything in such a monumental way, and for that I thought these movies were worth reviewing. This has been Project: Hellraiser. Glad you’ve been along for the ride.

I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to resist writing about relationships because of the judgements I have towards myself in relation to relationships and how I have fucked myself up within this point of who I am as myself as my own self relationship where in I basically see myself as a complete fuck-up with so far to go that to even think about relationships brings a point of despair in thinking how far away this point of me actually being in an effective agreement must be due to how much I have accepted and allowed myself to fuck myself and continue to fuck myself and have not found it within myself to actually walk in self respect and self dignity and self honesty so that I actually see myself as fit for an agreement or relationship with another being.

Cut a piece of sturdy no-stretch string about 1 inch shorter (for really big buttons, maybe 2” shorter) than the proposed button band. Determine desired number of buttons, then subtract 1 from that number and fold the string into that number of sections. Example: for 5 total buttons, 5-1=4, so fold the string into 4 equal sections. Mark each of the three resulting folds with a pin. Straighten the string. The top and bottom button are to be centered on the very ends of the string, and the intervening three buttons are to be centered on each pin in the string segment. Measure each string segment to figure out how many inches of band to allow between the holes. If using vertical buttonholes, remember that the pin shows the buttonhole center, not bottom so start the actual buttonhole accordingly.

I once heard someone say that habits are like submarines, they are silent and run deep. It would be wonderful to say that habits are not necessarily bad but unfortunately they usually happen because we have not thought of an alternative. We automatically carry out the action our brain tells us instead of doing what we may have actually planned.

The Vampire's Assistant, based on the popular series of books by Darren Shan called The Saga of Darren Shan, is a fantasy-adventure about a teenager who unknowingly breaks a 100-year-old truce between two warring factions of vampires, a peaceful group called the Vampire Clan who don't kill their victims, and a group of stereotypical bloodsucking killers called the Vampaneze. Pulled into a fantastic life of misunderstood sideshow freaks and grotesque creatures of the night, one teen will vanish from the safety of a boring existence and fulfill his destiny in a place drawn from nightmares.

It was my husband who first said I had pretty feet. I was 25 years old, and on the phone with my sister. While jabbering away Tony was playing with my feet and toes. As I playfully kicked him off he said, “You have beautiful feet.” I smiled at him and then intentionally looked at my feet, perhaps for the first time. Hmmm, I shook my head and shrugged. I saw nothing special. So what did he do? He gently placed a match between my toes and lit it. Smilingly, we both watched it burn. As I listened to my sister on the phone, I half-thought, “He’ll blow it out.” But when the flame reached my skin I reflexively flung the phone and kicked up my foot. He jumped in surprise as much as I did. “Why?!” I asked him – half shocked, half laughing. Hot Foot was the term I think he used. He honestly thought I’d shakeout the match before it burned me. Some joke. I was laughing when I told my sister what had happened. She was quiet. Silly newlyweds, she probably thought.
“Is this what being an adult is like?” he asks me, fresh from a frustrating 18th-birthday morning spent with his dad at the DMV at the bank, battling bureaucratic bullshit and accomplishing exactly nothing. We look at each other, John and I, and John says, “Pretty much.”
December 19, 2011 ~ WOW!! So much has happened in the last 2 weeks...it has been a whirlwind! We were going to wait to tell the kids about all this until the homestudy was done but there was no way. There is so much we need to talk about and it was getting too hard to try to only talk about it when they weren't around. So, we told Eli and Olivia the exciting news on 12/8. I wrapped the book "I Love You Like Crazy Cakes" and made a little piece of paper that all hinted about the adoption. They are sooo excited but they want her here NOW!! We also went on our pre-training service on Dec. 10th up in Cleveland at the adoption agency. We got to meet Uncle Joe (from China). We learned so much about post-adoption troubles that day, very eye opening. So, this week I have been a busy bee and literally got ALL the homestudy paperwork done and submitted!! A total of 14 documents (and our autobiographies). We have come so far in just 1 week. I'm on a mission to bring my baby girl home fast!! Here is a list of the documents submitted:

I woke up at 2:46 am. The night nurse was in our room. She was doing CPR. On Sawyer. She was saying over and over again, “The baby is not breathing.” I could not comprehend what was happening. One year and 1 month later I still do not understand. I doubt I ever will.
Yeah, we got along okay. With Daddy I mostly stayed outta his way, but Mama and me, we had ourselves some good times talking about all the stuff we was gonna do. Mama wasn’t like most mamas, she didn’t like cooking and cleaning, she said life was too short for such nonsense, she said we was put on earth to be happy and that’s what she was trying to do. I felt real good when Mama said I took after her and was not like Daddy; I never wanted to be like Daddy.
Overall the beers were well kept and enjoyable, even if not strictly my cup of tea. There was a really good mix of locals and comforts (visitors, i.e. those who comfort day) and the staff were very chatty and friendly. I would certainly recommend a visit to both these pubs if you are in the area, as they were the highlight of an otherwise uninspiring Easter day out. I really, truly, honestly, cannot recommend you go for any other reason though....
I have heard criticism of the fact that we are declaring a bank holiday to commemorate those who have died at work. Surprisingly, no-one criticised bank holidays given to celebrate royal weddings or winning court cases later lost on appeal. This day is much more poignant, enduring and relevant and I am hugely proud to have been able to declare it a holiday.

This picture shows how I placed the pliers right in the center of the petal and wrapped it around the pliers. After I shaped all the flowers, I used my heat gun to dry them. Once they are dry, they hold their shape really well. I layered three flowers to create the "fluffy" flower. One large delicate snowflake and one small sun were glued together to create the stamen. I used brown card stock for the stamen and added gold to the points.

Every time Dad has come to visit & Lenny was in the barn or near where we were, he'd just smile. Smile & remember that little runt calf sucking on his finger. As he aged, Lenny's disposition remained wonderful! He was never a bull to be mean or aggressive. In fact, we never left him with the other bulls because they'd pick on him. Even the little bulls would pick on him. Lenny sired Ultimate & Freedom, many more & just a week ago Lacey (my pet cow) had a Lenny Bull Calf.

Appearing to him in a dream, God confronted Solomon with a proposal—He would give Solomon whatever he desired. Solomon’s answer is nothing if not splendid. Acknowledging his vast inadequacies, he asks God to help him complete the impossible tasks before him. “I am only a little child and do not know how to carry out my duties. So give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong.” Instead of asking for things for himself, he asked for nothing more than the ability to do well what he was called to do, which was to govern Israel with justice.

My mother in law: That was a hard one, she remembers. She is now in her 60s. I don't ask for details, though she might tell. It is enough (too much) to consider what I know already. She met her husband when she was still a girl, 13 or 14. What would it be like, to know only one man, your entire life. How disappointing it would be, how sad. Others call this beautiful. Maybe I don't know anything.

I made a drawing of a weird tree. It had blue leaves, pink fruits, and a purple trunk. I drew a girl who had corresponding colorful features. She had blue hair, pink eyes, and purple skin. She was the guardian of the tree, and so she was the only one who could pick a fruit from the tree. Anyone else who tried to get climb the tree to get its fruits would die. The fruits never fell to the ground. Anyone who was given the fruit would have immense power.

Bloomberg reports the GE CFO, Keith Sherin, talking about the sale ““A lot of things are getting better around the world, but the Irish mortgage portfolio was one place we didn’t see the outlook improving,” Keith Sherin, GE’s chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview. “We made a determination that the buyer’s bid would be a better deal than to continue to work on that portfolio and try to increase the value over time.” The sale of the unit, which has $600 million in assets, may be concluded by the end of this year, Sherin said.”

In a large bowl, combine the first 6 ingredients. Crumble the beef over the mixture and mix well. Shape into a round loaf; place in the crockpot. Cover and cook on low for about 6 hours. In a small mixing bowl, combine the ketchup, brown sugar, and worcestershire sauce. Gently pour it over the meat loaf. Cook for about 15 minutes or until heated through. Let stand for about 15 - 20 minutes before cutting. Serve with some garlic mashed potatoes and your favorite vegetable, and your family will think it was the best meatloaf ever.

Biggest revelation: I am strong! Much, much stronger than I ever imagined! Regardless of the physical pains I’ve endured here, I’ve maintained a positive attitude for the most part! I’ve figured out how to get from here to there and back again on my own. When the need for help arose, I asked for and accepted it graciously. When I was scared, I searched inside for strength and found it! And when I was lonely, I let myself feel loneliness and recognize it could be as short-lived as I wanted it to be! There have been people in my life who said I lack self-confidence. Maybe I projected that because I felt the need to be what was expected of me at the time. Travelling alone, I found the space to be just me and found that they were wrong about me. I AM STRONG!!

I think that it’s interesting to note that I have never had the reason for a party not having legal representation be financial. Parenthetically, I would note that Israel actually has a fairly extensive and competent system of Legal Aid, and those who fit the financial criteria are eligible for representation in all matters of Family Law (with the exception of those trying to milk the system while refusing to give a get.) In addition, the Israel Bar Association sponsors a pro-bono program for people with limited means who make too much money to be eligible for Legal Aid, but don’t have enough money to pay for a lawyer.

It's hard to fathom that this seemingly unending rollercoaster called 2011 can be summed up so shortly at the end of the ride. But I'll take those two ideas, tuck them into my hat as hard earned life lessons and keep on truckin'. Some of you may see these things as obvious, and the concepts are admittedly incredibly basic. But real life application is much harder than spewing words…. at least I can say that not only do I 'get it', I'm now fully living it.

I thought my beer trip was over, but in a few hours, I found myself sitting at Hopworks, with sampler trays and mugs littering my table. Beers of note that I really enjoyed were two seasonals: dark helmet lager, and pig war imperial IPA. The pig war, in particular, was a pleasant surprise for me. I've really fallen out of love for hoppy beers over the last year or so, but just when I thought I was out... this one pulled me back in! Very well balanced, incredibly smooth, not too bitter, and elegantly floral with soft citrus notes, I will certainly return to this one if the opportunity arises.

They walked to the parking lot towards her car, away from the horde of fans waiting for him at the tour bus. She said “You shouldn’t leave your fans disappointed”. “Not to worry” he said. “Most of them are happy enough with Pretty Boy Billy”. As they drove towards her house, she glanced over at him. ”Well I would imagine you have all kinds of girlfriends everywhere”, trying to sound nonchalant about the images playing in her head. He stared at her a moment. “Well”, he said, “Let me be perfectly honest”. “So before this goes too far, let me tell you what you are. You’re amazing, I’m attracted, but I’m terribly distracted. And I’m trying to be verbal, and I’m back into this circle because I just found someone special. And that’s really something special if you knew me. Nice to meet you, nice to meet you, nice to meet you anyway. And even if you want me to stay here, I’m telling you right now I should leave before I get to changing my mind, dear. I hope you understand what I mean.”
I love coffee in the morning; I love that burnt and earthy smell drifting into my peripheries. But I’d much prefer the drift of a younger crowd and a conversation. I dream of the poets and philosophers of Paris and London in the regency coffee shops or Bakunin, Blanc and International Workingmen’s Association.

I wasn't sure how I felt about this book - it's one of those slow reads, not a lot of action but also not a lot of internal reflection/philosophy. It's written from the viewpoint of Dell, as a 60-something, looking back on his life over half a century earlier, mostly in the voice of someone without a lot of education but eager to hide that fact with somewhat stilted language.
The first-rate introduction of the Dream Lord in this episode overshadows the lameness of the old people monsters. Toby Jones relishes his role as the Doctor’s dark side, and takes obvious joy in taunting our hero with lines like, “I’m surprised you haven’t got a little purple space dog, just to ram home what an intergalactic wag you are!” The story had us wondering along with the characters as to which was the genuine reality, and wondering if the Dream Lord was some incarnation of the dreaded Valyard. We definitely want to see more of Toby in Season Six. Amy’s Choice is easily among the funniest episodes of the new season, thanks in part to Rory’s hair.
It was a wet Monday morning and Mr P and Mrs Rine had gone their separate ways to work with the common expression of somebody who has lost Johnny Walker and found Chris Evans.
Every New Year's I make that famous resolution - I'm pretty sure you've made it yourself. "I will lose weight this year! Get healthy! Exercise! Eat less Sugar! Eat more salads!" Or some variation on the theme. We want, wish and hope for a trim body and vibrant health. It's the "doing" that gets messy.

I went white. Cool. Crisp. Fruity. It’s summer in a glass. I used a Sauvignon Blanc because it’s one of my favorite white wines. Use what you like. The pineapple adds a summer sweetness that makes you wish your feet were bare and in the sand. And if you can wait until the end of the glass, the wine soaked fruit will have you licking your fingers and wanting more. Maybe well-mannered people use a fork. But I don’t know any of those.
Or what about the distraught girl who calls me at 2 AM because she needs a ride home after her date got drunk at a party and she refused to get in the car with him, and he left without her, and she didn't know who else to call because her parents wouldn't understand because they had warned her to stay away from that guy (yes, I know that's a run-on sentence. Shut up, I'm on a roll here). Yes, I'm aware of the risk of misinterpretation when a male teacher is seen driving a female student home at 2 in the morning, especially after she's been drinking; and yes I'm aware that the "safer" response would have been to tell her to call her parents and hope that they'll understand because they love her. But I've never been one to take the "safe" route - I help people when they ask me for help, and I don't worry about what other people might think. I give my home phone number to every student, every year on the first day of school, and I tell them to call me if they ever need ANYTHING, any time, day or night. Those aren't just words. Sometimes they take me up on it, and I'll be damned if I'm going to turn my back on them when they do.

Those sentiments are probably very familiar to many of alt.adoption’s citizens, as we’ve heard them many times. Other phrases that might ring bells are ‘why disrupt all those lives?’, ‘why open up a can of worms?’ ‘why rock the boat?’, or another quote from “Lost and Found”, “I don’t think there could be a more selfish quest than this.” (p.75)

Where has the time gone?! And what in the world am I doing in my career? Do I even really have a career, or am I just working? How did I get to where I am right now? Am I happy? I don't know anymore. But I am generally a happy person! I firmly believe in waking up in the morning and choosing your attitude - a good attitude! And invoking grace in the face of others' bad behavior. You know, killing 'em with kindness. Maybe even trying out what my sister suggested, "faking 'til I feel it."

The writing style is a hybrid of fiction and non-fiction. Lengthy chapters written in a documentary format as though in a history book are given over to explaining how this world came to be. It takes a while for the story proper to get going and the interludes feel jarring as the story halts for a lengthy exposition. This is the worst of the sins and if you can forgive that then you are in a for a good old-fashioned science ficton adventure yarn for most of the first 3/4 of the book.
Fast-forward to December. By the time I'm on my way to work, the sun has barely risen, and chances are I'm trudging through rain, slush, or usually a mix of both. Everyone looks gloomy, hidden underneath scarves and coats and the morning fog. And the cute little park? Well, it's empty and filled with remnants of fall leaves, making the ground slippery and forcing anyone to look at their feet rather than at the sky.

In theory by setting up these plantations and farming operations it allows the companies to employ local workers, creating more employment, and also allows the workers to benefit from cheap use of the product. In reality however it has, on the whole, not really turned out this way.

By 2020, 50 billion devices will be connected to the network, according to Padmasree Warrior, senior vice president of engineering and the chief technology officer at Cisco.

I’m not the only one that is in pain in the house at the moment – Mrs B and I were having dinner the other night, when a loud screech disrupted the night air and the cat flap erupted in a ball of black fur that streaked through the kitchen, leaving a trail of black fuzz like an etch-a-sketch pad in the hands of an active epileptic.... Mrs B almost hit the roof, while I took the opportunity to check the underside of the table to make sure it was safe.... when Mrs B had returned to terrafirma and I had finished off the vital (and long overdue) table safety inspection, we went in search of a rather disturbed Mischief. We discovered the poor thing in one of the spare rooms, puffed up to twice her normal size (very impressive considering the amount of fur that had been distributed along her epic escape route), her little heart pumping away like a small boy who has just discovered underwear catalogues. Her tale had a rather distinct kink in it and she spent the next few days struggling to sit down and getting very tetchy at any attempt to inspect the damage. We are not sure what attacked her (Fox, neighbourhood cat, territorial robin), although to be honest she can be a bit neurotic at times, I have seen her panic and streak across the garden after doing a poo (truly a case of being scared shitless).

There’s a prayer that gets used at AA and NA workshops sometimes. It goes like this: God, please set aside everything I think I know about myself, the twelve steps, this book, the meetings, my disease, and you so I may have an open mind and a new experience with all these things. Let me see the truth.

The image was created using the marker to stamp technique after the initial inking of the entire teacup in Blushing Bride ink. I stamped the violet sprigged background on the Wisteria Wonder cardstock with Versamark, and added the Cup of Thanks sentiment on a Blushing Bride Modern Label Punch. The bow was created a little differently. I folded the bow, and then used sticky strip to wrap around the center and hold the shape. Adding the adorable Blushing Bride Button and Pearl gives it the extra detail that makes card-making fun!

What makes Gorod stand out in the sea of tech death bands is their ability to create superbly intricate, atmospheric music that's both heavy and beautiful. The first song on the album, Birds of Sulphur, features a brief, eerie introduction punctuated by an unnerving, dissonant orchestral layer, then dives straight into insanely fast and brutal riffing. It's a massive aural assault, with the two guitarists often engaging in extended, intertwining lead duels that are just spectacular to hear, while the bass carries the song's heaviness with its thick, warm, independent lines and the drummer puts the beating on his kit. The vocals gave me a bit of a scare at first, since the very first words are delivered in an over-processed, Behemoth-like voice, but thankfully the vocalist settles into a more composed growl interspersed with a few high-pitched shrieks.

Concentrated mainly in the lens and retina of the eye, lutein may help to protect vision by neutralizing free radicals and by increasing the density of eye pigment. Lutein may also shield the eyes from the destructive effects of sunlight. In late 2001, a British study reported that risk of cortical cataract was lowest with high concentrations of lutein.
Woo Jin learns that Dae Su and Mi Do have left her apartment and that she quit her job. Mi Do reveals that she's in love with Dae Su and they finally make love. Woo Jin tells his bodyguard that he's getting depressed and that they'll leave when this is done. At Dae Su's new place we see gas coming in under the door. Men in gas masks enter while they're out and leave a gift wrapped box on the table containing Mr. Park's hand, which Dae Su had threatened to chop off. This tells Dae Su that Woo Jin is listening to them. Mi-Do investigates "evergreen" and discovers the phrase "evergreen old boys" a term for attendees of Dae Su's high school. Mi Do and Dae Su visit the school and find Woo Jin's picture, as well as the fact that in the same class a girl, Soo Ah, has had her pictures cut out of the yearbook. Dae Su calls Joo Hwan to ask about this and he tells Dae Su that Soo Ah died after Dae Su transferred out of the school. Describing her, Joo hwan says that she apparently committed suicide, jumping off a bridge and that "She was a total slut. On the outside she acted just like a prude, a good girl, inside she was really wild. Rumors had it that slut fucked everyone at school! I should have gotten a piece of her." Joo-Hwan doesn't realize that Woo jin is in the internet cafe with him, eavesdropping. Enraged at what he's hearing, he kills Joo-hwan. He then gets on the call with Dae Su and tells him "My sister wasn't a slut!'
Outerwear: A well appointed gentleman’s wardrobe will also include appropriate outerwear, coats, raincoats, etc. If a coat is to be worn over a suit jacket, it should ideally be longer than the jacket so that it covers the jacket completely apart from at the front. There is little point in building up a wardrobe of suitably stylish clothing which is covered by an ugly coat.

Excerpts from the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act:
And yes, I am a complete anomaly on campus. Most of my classmates are far more conventional in their sartorial choices, and I do get my fair share of dirty looks and mockery.... but it's fine, as I'd feel much worse if I dressed in modern casual styles just to fit in. I can honestly say I've never in my life owned sweatpants (if you're wondering, I wore patterned leggings to gym class back in the day) and I'm not about to start. Now, I am not judging you lucky things who can pull that off, but in my own experience I've found dressing nicely helps me stay alert and focused in class, gives me some much-needed confidence when navigating the world, and shows my professors respect. (And then there's the part where I frankly don't care all that much for 21st century aesthetics, haha...)

Saying good-bye is never easy, and I'm torn between hating to say good-bye to friends that I love and care about, but also knowing that we really need that break from each other too. We need time away to learn to be empathetic, kind, caring and tolerant of each other again, and just learn to be good people because if we expect it of our students, we need to expect it of ourselves.

Not everything in F1 is aggressive, extreme, radical or innovative. In fact in many areas the car’s are very close in general design terms. Some times it’s enough just to soak up the detail engineering and explain what all the little bits and pieces do on the car.

Following on from the details of the Force India front corner, with these photos of the Caterham in Melbourne, we can now see more of the upright design.
I’m excited that I might soon be able to get up on the bed all by myself. It’s just a little too tall for me, still. But I’ve also gotten into the tub, which is only a few inches shorter than the bed. I keep trying…. one day I’ll get up there.
They’re businesses, only worse. Those at the top of most big law firms function with far greater independence than corporate CEOs who must answer to a board of directors and shareholders. In many big firms, a growing internal wealth gap reinforces the hubris of senior leaders who answer to no one — except each other. With Dewey’s disintegration, we’re seeing where that can lead.

The University of Texas at Dallas accepted me on short notice.

This is really too hard. I think some of the most moving myths are those which deal head on with our own mortality. Orpheus in the underworld, trying to rescue his dead wife Eurydice. Achilles in Hades telling Odysseus ‘do not try to console me for dying. I would rather be a peasant and follow my master’s plough than be king over all the perished dead.’ And Baldur from the Norse myths, who cannot be brought back to life even though all the world wept for him (save Loki).

Jinx was lying on her bed fast asleep. “Oh, Jinx!” she sniffled. No matter how awful the day, somehow Lisa was always happy to see her pet cat. The sight of him was like a magnet to her – she could hardly ever resist stroking him or picking him up. She stood the strange-looking bottle on her bedside table and began to tell the cat why she felt so unhappy.
I had contemplated going out on my own as a post-production business, editing and doing animation and graphics and making original music, but it always seemed so risky and costly that I never made any real motions to do so.

The word of God puts coveteousness right in with fornication and uncleaness. To have coveteousness is to strongly desire something you really dont need. It is to think about it a lot. The dictionary says: “To wish for longingly.” Our tradition of having our children make a list of what they want needs to be tempered so that it does not lead to coveteousness. It is okay to want something, and to give something. But we need to be careful not to breed a spirit of coveteousness in them. Make sure they realize we are giving gifts to one another in honor of Jesus’ gift to us. Make sure they are involved in giving as well as getting.
I originally balked at the price but I knew I would have to pay a lot for a long down coat. I could not believe how light weight it is. It is warm, flattering, very easy to wear. My work colleagues were jealous. We seem to have been in a down coat competition this year. Mine is the longest and keeps my legs warm. I have received complements on this coat from strangers in the street., I bought this parka for my mom. It’s really nice. She liked the color and the style….
Another high point for 2012...we have planned our Vacation-Palooza. We are going back to Negril, Jamaica. If thoughts of swimsuits and shorts isn't enough to motivate me to get moving (along with the above-mentioned events), then I am not sure what is! I really want to be rocking some new clothes for the trip!!! I CANNOT WAIT!!! The resort where we are staying is a five-star resort...so we feel like celebrities (though I like to think that we are much better mannered than some...we WILL sign autographs, even if you interrupt our lunch...:)).

So this is where we get into trouble. One thing that all of these “P” words have in common is the fact that they are not achievable by human beings.

Last year the wooden rocking chair we got from freecycle also suffered an injury, from the kids who loved it, perhaps a little too much, and again I kept the parts thinking I could fix it, but as it turns out it would have cost a fair bit to sort it out, so the the bits stayed in my shed.
Final Word: Should See
I always try to take the high road, I may not ALWAYS succeed, but the majority of the time I do. People look at me as weak when I take the high road. I've gotten asked "doesn't that piss you off?!" Well of course it does, but going off on someone rarely fixes the problem, usually makes it worse. I'd much rather be patient and allow things to fall into place then get all worked up about it and potentially say or do something stupid.
An intention can be large and lengthy (I want to become a doctor) or small and immediate (I need to get my resume to XYZ company today!) You can accomplish the latter in a few minutes, but the former will likely take many years. There is no restriction to how many intentions you can set.
In the January 2012 episode, actor Mike Daisey tells the story of his trip to Shenzhen, China where millions of Chinese workers work in near slavery conditions to assemble the various tech products, clothing, and toys that we Americans bring home by the cartload. He tells the story of the unconventional strategies that he used to get inside the Foxconn factory that assembles iPhones, Macbooks, and other assorted Apple products. He reveals his firsthand account of a country where human labor is so cheap that even our most high-tech gadgets are assembled by hand – millions of hands crippled by performing the same task on an assembly line for hours on end. He describes a massive building with security guards at the exits and nets strung up on the sides of the building in response to a recent surge in employee suicides. He tells us of the dorms where employees sleep – twelve foot square rooms with fourteen beds stacked floor to ceiling – each bunk space so narrow that one can only slide in “coffin-style.”

In the first level of Donkey Kong, the title ape does not use any sort of jungle weaponry to face Mario. Rather, they face off in some sort of factory, with DK hurling barrels at Mario as he seeks to reach the top of the level. This stage suggests that the black man has become dangerous living within white society; that he can use white folks’ own tools as weapons against the status quo. While Donkey Kong throws tools at Mario, the carpenter has his own weapons to rely upon. The hammers hanging in the level make obvious tools of attack, and yet Mario, following the pacifistic ways of Christ, uses them as tools. Rather than attack his kidnapper, he smashes the oncoming barrels with the sledges. The first level of the video reinforces the old and very racist stereotypes that the white man is smarter than the inherently violent and foolhardy black man.

Even so, it is clear that his influence did seep into various exile circles, often influencing further generations of exile students through them. This is clear, all else apart, from the usage of the term "organic intellectual", a Gramscian term, which can not infrequently be heard in the mouths of Left activists, let alone the continual stress on the need for ANC "hegemony", Gramsci's central concept.

She is definitely the most stubborn and determined of our girls. And she isn't afraid to let you know in extreme volume when she doesn't like something.
In the 50 years since oil was discovered in Nigeria, over $400 billion have been realised as revenue but the money has been stolen by the politicians and the corrupt civil servants leaving Nigerians to fend for themselves. The evil genius Abacha and his family were able to bank $4 billion of these monies in Switzerland, Jersey Island, New York, Australia, France and Britain. The story is no different in Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, DRC, Guinea, Chad, Zambia, Sudan, Liberia, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Algeria, Sierra Leone and Gabon where oil, gas, gold, diamond, copper and other valuable minerals have brought in billions of dollars yet most the people live in abject poverty. The people are poor because the Slave Masters have decided they should remain so, as monies meant for their development have been stolen and are sitting in UBS, Credit Suisse, Barclays bank, BNP, Crédit Lyonnais and Citibank.

Ghana's experimentation with Bus Rapid Transit is a misnomer; it's fully on course, with ads on radio on some stations in full swing. Wikipedia describes it thus:
And that is also why what is here called "neoliberalism' has at times also been called "neoconservatism". These days, however, "neoconservatism" is usually applied to a much different set of ideas -- of which a little more shortly.
Today was a ridiculous cliche, couldn't look out the window or listen to the sounds of the day without feeling like I was stuck in the middle of an old-school country song. If my mom had gotten thrown in prison, I believe the day would have come full circle.
But. I was vegan from around the age of 19 to the age of 30 or so, and then again in fits and starts through my 30s. My path away from veganhood was a complicated mixture of changing feelings and experiences with death, difficult pregnancies (and kid(s) who had allergies, difficulty eating, and/or difficulty gaining weight), and perspective. My primary reason for being a vegan then is the same as my primary reason for being vegetarian: aesthetically, meat grosses me out. I had a hard time with eggs before eggs became a necessary option for me and/or my kids. But also–I just didn’t like the idea of things dying.
Tomas Osmeña’s message is clear, Sinulog should not be mixed with politics!
Today is one of those days. What I’m feeling is not self-pity, although it might well be sheer exhaustion. My personal world at home is solid, and my professional world gets steadily better fiscally (for the most part; there certainly are exceptions). I can summon the edge when I need it. In spite of it all, uncertainty is gnawing at me. You wouldn’t know it from reading this blog, because apparently I’ve gotten very functional at being dysfunctional.

As a surprise pressie I received a copy of this book from my husband this weekend. Strangely despite my drinking habits and enjoyment of pubs I don't buy beer or pub guides although I do have a copy of the Good Beer Guide on my iPad but again that was the other half loading it on before giving me the thing. However it is a very very good book to get a bit of history of the pub you are currently sitting in or thinking of getting to. The maps that head each section are clear and useful, which should make the process of finding some of them easier.
Can my lack of focus really be related to not rubbing one down? The anxiety and fragmentation of my thoughts and actions? As I said, I continued to think about this, through dinner, through the baby’s bedtime. And I was fucking wet, just from thinking about masturbating… Not even imagining doing it, but just thinking about this whole concept. Shortly after the munchkin was asleep, I followed M to bed, and we fucked. Good and hard, but quietly (both baby and step-mom in the house). And I came. A lot.

Daughter of Smoke and Bone by Laini Taylor has received a great deal of pre-publication buzz - trailers, limited proofs and plenty of information. This often makes me a little concerned about whether the book can possibly live up to all my expectations. With the case of Daughter of Smoke and Bone, I am pleased to say my expectations were absolutely surpassed - this is an exceptionally special book.
Much of yesterday was about preparing and preparing the chickens and eggs to go to the market. So I helped packaged eggs and load up the canopy. My friend Karen butchered and prepared the chickens. It was going to be a hot day by Oregon standards I think it got up to the late 80’s early 90’s. By my Texas standards it was still a pretty cool day out.

I find it very difficult to judge the size and quality of the toys from online resources. My primary concern was that the removable pieces would be too small and pose a choking risk. Or that the plastic would be thin or flimsy. Having seen the products first hand, I am very reassured! The plastic is thick and hard, but textured so as not to become slippery once it is drooled on.
Why It Worked: El Jefe is a German-style Hefeweizen, which means that it's heavy in banana, orange and clove flavors. The amuse-bouche served its purpose and let us know that the new sous chef was serious about impressing us. A dish of fried parma ham was topped with cantaloupe that had been prepared in tiny balls the size of salmon roe and was dressed with tiny congealed balsamic drops and olive oil. The melon matched the citrus and banana flavors fantastically, while the salty fried ham helped cut through the heavy body of the beer. The clove flavors complimented the ham and the beer ensured that the intense ham did not overpower the palate.
Anyone who has seen this typically mesmeric Angelopoulos meditation on 'borders' (political, geographical, generational, psychological) speaks of the pure spectacle of the wedding across the river, which in perfect cinematic terms suggests the absurdity of nationalism - of claiming place - as an affront to the natural human instinct to create links between people. It is, in its presentation, one of the boldest of Angelopoulos's great set-pieces, and one of the defining moments of this, his greatest film.

“The head of police was my father’s friend,” my acquaintance continued. “Long before those riots, he often warned my Dad not to send us children to school on certain days, or not to go to a particular part of town. He was our friend, you see, but even he was part of it. He was trying to frighten us, to make us leave.”
I made a start on a big clean up this afternoon. I do love a declutter, as many of you will know. I cleared out a fair bit of junk, and I haven't even started on my wardrobe yet. I found about 300 of those tiny snaplock plastic bags with a spare button that you seem to get with every new item of buttonable clothing.
In order for Article 82(1) to apply, Samsung Electronics GmbH would need to be considered a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd (South Korea). This seems not to be the case. Due to the plaintiff's headquarters being situated in California, Article 82(2) could not be applied either.

As I gear up for spring and summer, I checked out Borealis on http://www.wine-searcher.com/ to see if it's locally available and I found a few stores near me that carry it. I was also pleased to find that at $10 - $15, it could make a good everyday white. Moreover, with its medium body and good acidity, it's something that could pair with something a little heavier than seafood.
Each day when you wake up you get a chance to choose what type of day you will have. You can choose to have a good or a bad day. Agreed, life can throw things at you when you least expect it, however it remains your choice as to how you deal with them.
I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to believe that I don’t desire an agreement or relationship because I have not wanted to go into relationships or agreements with others and believe that this means that I am evil and do not then deserve to be with anyone.

Recently this desire has been brought to the front of my mind. There is a constant nagging, a continuous reflection, serious thought towards making some actually progress. Last week while I was playing with one of my horses, I was suddenly hit with the fact that I have great stories to tell. This new belief caused me to take action. I researched writing software, then compared the three top prospects and choose the one I felt was simple enough for me.

Look at the numbers. Most craft brew drinkers are drinking Sam Adams Boston Lager, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, New Belgium Fat Tire Amber, Harpoon IPA (and Blue Moon Belgian White, if we're going to be honest and look at this in terms of "craft" styles). That's where the sales are that are getting us even close to 4%. I think things are going to shift even more towards those brands, because they'll have the steadiest prices and the most consistent product. Experimentation tends to go down when prices go up. Flagships will do well.
“What struck me was what I didn’t find, which was diversity,” said Herting. “When the historical society was founded, it was a private club, so a lot of the images were of upper-class New Englanders. I decided I would populate the archives, so in the future people looking through would find a more diverse group,” Herting said in 2009.

Ms Lappin recently announced that she was able to secure more than $86,000 for Roosevelt Island based organizations from this year's New York City Budget. However, when you compare $86,000 for local Roosevelt Island organizations to the $2 million in each of the next two years she helped secure for FERI's Kahn/FDR boondoggle, a much more clear picture of Ms. Lappin's Roosevelt Island priorities emerge and they are certainly not favorable to the residents of Roosevelt Island. Does she not realize that such funds would be of much better use helping Roosevelt Island's children at the Youth Center, Public Library or at PS/IS 217. Maybe her priorities would be better spent assisting the Senior Citizen Center or helping to insure that affordable housing remains available at Roosevelt Island instead of ruining Southpoint Park with the Louis Kahn/FDR memorial. Even if you believe the memorial is a good idea, it certainly should not be receiving public taxpayer funds during the current City and State budget crisis.
Just 20 percent are life-only contracts that offer no guarantee period at all. A lot of quotes go out with the 10-year period certain option included, Baker notes. “That option is popular because it removes the behavioral barrier to purchase—that is, the concern that if the person buys a product without that option and then dies soon after, the estate will get none of the money.”

Athanasius’s life can be summed up in the phrase de decretis (“Defending the Nicene Creed”). Athanasius’ main opponent was Arian, who charged that Jesus was not eternal but was created and therefore could not be God (p. 175). After Nicaea, Emperor Constantine tried to order Bishop Athanasius to readmit Arius to the church but Athanasius refused, for Arius rejected the Nicene principle of homoousios (the Father and Son were of the same substance), which Arian rejected (p. 178). For Athanasius, this was not simply a matter of semantics. “The Incarnate Christ had to be fully man and fully God in order to lift human beings back into God’s life” (p. 182). Orthodox evangelicals are indebted to Athanasius for articulate responses and tremendous courage as he stood against the world in the fight for truth (p. 183).

(10) We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that everyone may receive the things done in his body, according as he has done either good or bad” (II Cor. 5:10). Since, however, there is then to be satisfaction according to men’s merits, how will anyone be able to reckon with God? By mentioning both the judgment seat and the distinction between good and bad works, he sets before us a Judge who is to award both sentences. He has thereby affirmed that all will have to be present at the tribunal in their bodies.

Now, Reggie Evans is a wicked story. I was watching him last night away from the ball, and he’s incredible. Firstly, he entered the game to huge cheers and he immediately grabs a reeb, sets a monstrous pick for Paul that leads to an easy jay, and then comes back on dee and was facing up Gasol and grabs the steal. All in like, thirty seconds. Blam. The guy is a pro. But if you watch him real close, he’s titty twisting guys and scratching and pushing and clawing and all seemingly innocent battles for rebounds and positioning but it reminds me of a story I read about him when he played for the Sixers and a dude was trying out for the squad and how the dude wrote he battled Reggie Evans all scrimmage and was left with red welts and bruises, scratches, and cuts all over his body. Dude had never had that happen. So, watch Reggie close and watch his hands. And how he squeezes dudes. It’s kind of remarkable. And I think he gets away with the Perfect Weapon hands because he’s not necessarily planting moving picks or kneeing dudes or climbing over dudes’ backs. He’s just grabbing at ya. Well, he does do all of what I just wrote. He probably learned from watching Dennis Rodman and remember Ryan W. (U and S logo artist) telling us how Rodman would put his thumb in unique places on opposing dudes’ bodies? And, I just now got your “stuff like that” joke/riff. Sir Reggie was a Raptor and that was probably uttered in every sentence of his when interviewed. We of the Toronto Raptor fan base.
I think this is flat out absurd. Whether or not you like the Occupy protestors and/or their tactics, they have set up tents to “occupy” spaces in an attempt to make things better for everyone by calling attention to what many beyond the Occupy movement have identified as serious problems with our economy, and with the government that is ostensibly one of its stewards.

I remember in the Bible book of Exodus, when the Israelites were leaving Egyptian bondage they looted the Egyptians and took away a great deal of gold and jewelry. Was that stealing? No, the Egyptians had no right to enslave them so they owed the Israelites back pay. Well, the Watchtower Society owes me back pay and should be forced to pay for my psychological counseling in freeing myself from their mind-control. I want my youth back so I can make different decisions. I entered into a contract with the JW’s when I was 15. Such a contract is not binding. The steps I take now are in direct response to their continued need to try to control my life and thinking.

But a great little homewares shop in town (The Flying Fish, Nanaimo) had some wonderful cushions using recycled saris to embroider designs on a neutral background -- you can see one, with the zigzag patterns above, and another below, with the three large stylized flowers at the right below. By my standards, they were expensive ($90 each!!), so I hesitated a day or two, but I suspected they would be the key to pulling together a collection of less expensive pillows.

When you assist at Holy Mass, offer our Saviour’s precious blood to the eternal Father, beseeching his Divine Majesty to receive the blood of his only Son, which you may offer as belonging to you by his free gift. Beg him to take it and pay himself therewith, for what you are indebted to him by your sins; and ask victory over them, and pardon for them. Have confidence that he will grant your request for his dear Son’s sake, but acknowledge that having so long continued in sin, you deserve to die in it; nevertheless hope in the precious blood that pleads for you, and demands its price and salary, having been shed to cleanse you from your sins.

I sometimes dream of a getaway - the chance to get away from my problems, from bills and job-hunting, from the stresses of everyday life. My ideal getaway location?

Someplace where I only need a bathing suit, a sarong, a hair clip and my sunglasses. Paradise.

Stacey and I got up and around about noon, and went by the Mercato Santa Ambrogio. The Market Stacey frequents, and it’s really close to her apartment and Santa Croche. I love going to markets. They’re such a beautiful gathering place. You see all types of people: the vendors were singing, women were walking their dogs, customers bartering and and friends meeting and gossiping in beautiful, smooth Italian. I loved it. I bought some beads for my mom and me, to make jewelry, and I bought some amazingly delicious olives for Stacey and I to take on our picnic we had planned for that day.

Certainly, God could have skimped a little.

“Filling out your profile, that’s a behavior LinkedIn wants to motivate.

That’s what games do—they are systems that give people pleasure.”

But, on the whole, the more prominent of these got short shrift. Mandela, in an interview with the Cape-based journal, South, just before his release from prison, made that adequately clear: "Co-operation between the ANC and SACP goes back to the early 1920s . . . even within the ranks of the ANC there have been at one time or other, people - and some of them were highly respected and influential individuals - who were against this cooperation and who wanted SACP members expelled from the organisation.

A systolic blood pressure of about 140 mmHg makes people happy too – however, I do not routinely lower systolic blood pressure, regardless of the original level, with medications, if that means also reducing the diastolic pressure below 80 mmHg – the risks are too great for more stroke and heart attacks. (Remember, without medications a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg or lower is ideal.)

Friday: It was more lab work on Friday. We started the day in the Microbiology lab plating more microorganisms. I had studied this subject matter a bit the night before so it felt a little better. My lab partner Viet and I were able to identify everything we plated which made me feel good. What didn't make me feel good was when were informed of what we should study for the test. Let's just say I have my work cut out for me.

This beer pours a beautiful dark yellow/orange color with a decent sized head that dissipated quite quickly and left spotty lacing on my glass. I get a good dose of fruit in the nose including apples, pears, oranges, and some Belgian style yeast in the nose. The fruit is the most dominant flavor in the flavor profile with pears and apple being the main players, and there are also flavors of lemon, pepper, and a slight hint of banana as well. The mouthfeel has medium carbonation with a fairly dry finish with the alcohol only barely noticeable. The drinkability is quite nice even at 7.75%, and I would have never guessed it was that high if I didn't read it on the bottle.

Now, maybe it was my heightened adrenaline, something getting the creativity going, but I had a light-bulb moment, a kind of "thought experiment" which has absolutely obsessed me ever since. It was: "What if there was something like a god, who could observe every human and know everything about them; and what if he could see everyone passing and meeting and mostly not meeting and weaving unpredictably from place to place, NEVER aware how narrowly they had just missed an important encounter with someone they knew or someone who might influence their lives? What if humans could be tracked like radioactive particles, bobbing around in a kind of Brownian motion, in patterns, and that the god was sitting there cackling at the powerlessness of these poor humans as they went down that street or took that turning or missed that train or smiled at that person or had this thought caused by that sight or sound or breath of air on their face? What if he could show us all that, and we could observe the almost happenings, the near-misses, and if we could, just by observing, change the tiniest things that affect lives invisibly? And what if we could then tell the story of some of those things, show the inner workings of our world?"

The World of Late Antiquity: AD 150-750 was published in 1972 and created new interest in this previously over-looked period of history. Edward Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, first published in 1776, established the view that Barbarians and Christianity were the two most important factors in bringing about a violent end to the greatness of Rome, followed by almost a millennium of the “Dark Ages”, before the ‘light of learning’ was rekindled in the Renaissance. This narrative has remained dominant among historians until fairly recently. Peter Brown was an instrumental force in bringing about an alternate view of this period he had newly christened ‘Late Antiquity’. His vision is not one of destruction and darkness, but of dynamic transformation. His works are based not around political and military events, but around ideas like ‘continuity’, ‘synthesis’, and ‘transformation’ in other, non-traditional themes. This has opened up a whole new world of scholarship, and his historiography focuses not so much on political and military events in the ‘Thucydidean’ manner, but also synthesizes cultural, social, economic, anthropological, and religious themes together in a more ‘Herodotean’ tradition (a dichotomy discussed by his mentor, Italian historian Arnaldo Momigliano).

Bourbon Street! It’s its own kind of exciting but if you’re right on the main thoroughfare, things do get a little noisy. There are plenty of reasonably priced historic and modern hotels nearby that will allow you to get some quality sleep while you’re there.

Most new-wave ice-pop artisans acknowledge at least some debt to the paleta — a frozen fruit treat sometimes made with nuts, milk and spices that gained popularity along Mexico’s Pacific coast in the 1940s. Former pastry chef and Mexico City transplant Fany Gerson of La Newyorkina has a special connection to the confection: In fact, she’s publishing a book of recipes (titled “Paletas”) this month. There’s a store in the works, too, but for now, the best place to get ahold of her avocado, hibiscus or cajeta (caramelized goat’s milk) pops is her stall at the Hester Street Fair.

There is nothing that holds me here, nothing that forces me to stay, other than this blank page that needs filling. It is my choice to attempt to do that, and although I am more than willing, I still can’t come up with a subject that will interest me, let alone anyone else.

Summit is not a miracle cure. But for 50 years in America and for 21 years in South Africa, it’s been a trusted source for preparing students to be the kind of leaders who shape culture, rather than who are shaped by it. That’s why Evangelical leaders such as Dr James Dobson, Dr James Kennedy, Charles Colson and Josh McDowell endorse it so enthusiastically — and why they sent their children to Summit USA before college. There simply is no substitute for the excellent training and mentoring participants will get at the Biblical Worldview Summit (30 March - 5 April 2012).

This happened recently again with this person, only on a different subject. He/she wanted to do everything he/she could to prove I was wrong. Really?

My brother and I decided a while ago that when it came to coming up with a title, we would both brainstorm and write down ideas – any and all – that we could think up over, say, a week. Then we’d send them to each other and decide which were our favorite. Then we’d talk until we both decided on one that we felt fit the book (though I have final say, my brother is as creative in many ways as I am, and his ideas usually have good reason behind them).

I rearranged my clothes, took my hair down out of its ponytail in what I hoped was a Pantene-esque mane of shiny beauty, and stared fixedly at the book open in front of me. Was it history?

There’s also some truly strong and smart women (ie: Catelyn Stark, Danaerys Targaryan, the mildly gender-bending tomboy Arya Stark, Cersei Lannister), really shrewd political subplots (ie: Varys, Baelish, the Lannisters), and even one character who works around a prominent disability with his sharp mind and tongue (Tyrion Lannister, with perhaps Bran Stark, Jon Snow, and Sam to follow in his wake, each with their own ‘disabilities’ to overcome, depending on how that word is conceived, physically, socially, etc.). The healer from the Lamb-people also shows quite shrewdly the costs of war, and modes of resistance, in a form that’s simply not the norm for mainstream television.

As I sit down to type this post, it's nearly 10 pm EST. I just realized that exactly 7 years ago at this time I was laying in a hospital bed, clad in a flimsy gown and hooked to all sorts of monitors. Our daughter is the first grandchild on both sides of our family, so both sets of our parents had made the trip to the hospital and were camped out in the waiting room. I'd just received the blessed epidural and a calm had fallen over the delivery room. I was propped up on pillows, watching Sunday night football with my husband and I was too excited to " just rest" as the nurse had advised me.

In summary – avoid fruit in favour of vegetables if weight loss and great health are your goals. And be selective int he vegetables you chose. Follow the paleo diet and in this way, your weight will continue to fall off. Finally avoid those public health campaign messages….or at least investigate for yourself and check that the findings are based on scientific evidence and not fuelled by an industry with a vested financial interest!

I think the theme of awareness is an extremely important one. However, I also believe that there are times in which, in order to best cope with your infertility, you may benefit from a little judicious, purposeful ignoring. I have come to the conclusion that there are certain interpersonal problems and experiences that are better left neglected. Intervention only makes them worse, and only makes us more miserable than necessary.

The other thing I've been thinking about is how all that makes me feel. Of course I believe its human nature to feel low when we are low and high when we are high... seems simple doesn't it? It's amazing how grim the future looked when I felt so poorly and yet how hopeful it seems when I feel better. I remind myself of a yo-yo going from one extreme to the other... I keep telling myself that I need to remember that so far things do get better and that sometimes it does take longer or even seems like it won't get better at all, but it will.
They were very different. Except in this sense, Iraq and Afghanistan were very different interventions in very different circumstances but one thing is the same in all of them which is that you had people living under the most brutal oppression and circumstances of deprivation really and I don’t think we should ever feel bad about liberating people from that situation. The circumstances in Iraq and Afghanistan are just so much bigger and there are so many other factors but in Kosovo and Sierra Leone I think we did demonstrate how if you do intervene you can give people a much better future. And if you don’t by the way as we learned in the early 90s in the Balkans when we didn’t then that is also a decision with consequences in which many people die.

The curious thing, of course, is that similar values were also observable in ancient Greece and Rome and may even have been what underlay the city-states of the original human civilization in Mesopotamia. The affinity of the Anglo-Saxon and Nordic people for democracy is certainly very reminiscent of ancient Greek democracy and the early Roman republic and, in turn, the city-states that characterized ancient Greece and Rome are very reminiscent of ancient Mesopotamia. What appears to have happened is that the human race has a great tendency towards centralization of government -- seen vividly in the Pharaohs of ancient Egypt, in the bureaucratic states of pre-modern China, in various Babylonian, Assyrian, Persian, Roman, Moghul and Ottoman empires, in the Kings of Mediaeval Europe and in the vast swathe of communist bureaucracies in the 20th century. And this centralizing tendency almost always seems to triumph over an even earlier tendency towards respect for the individual and a form of government that is directly responsive in some way to the popular will. And it is that very early tradition that only the Anglo-Saxons -- and their close relatives in Scandinavia and the Netherlands -- have carried forward into the modern world. Only among the Anglo-Saxons and their close relatives did the power of centralism never quite succeed in squashing human dreams for responsive, respectful and representative government. And it is this dream that conservatives of the English-speaking world carry forward today.
The other part of my PSP was commiting to using my reusable coffee mugs. I struggled with this one at first too, but I soon figured out ways to avoid forgetting my mug as much as possible. At first I really though I wouldn’t be able to get my roommates to join in on this one since these reusable mugs get kinda spendy. However, as I have been purchasing the mugs my roommates have been taking advantage of the supply of them in the cuboards. They weren’t initially doing it to be environmentally sustainable, they were trying to be financially sustainable. An average coffee costs about $3 and that starts to add up with the amount of coffee we all drink. My roommates want to save money so they actually like making coffee at home and taking it with them. I suplied the mugs and the sustainability spread through our apartment. I think that it is totally worth the cost of the four travle mugs I have bought this last month to have incouraged them to reduce even more. I also showed my roommates the Sustainability is Sexy website and they loved it! They were floored by the statistics it gives and loved the merchandise. They will be purchasing mugs and maybe even shirts now, thanks to me!

In an interview with Danish weekly Weekendavisen, Finkielkraut said that: “Racism is the only thing that can still arouse anger among the intellectuals, the journalists and people in the entertainment business, in other words, the elites. Culture and religion have collapsed, only anti-racism is left. And it functions like an intolerant and inhumane idolatry.” “A leader from one of the organizations against racism had the nerve to refer to the actions of the police in the Parisian suburbs as ‘ethnic cleansing.’ That kind of expression used about the French situation indicates a deliberate manipulation of the language. Unfortunately, these insane lies have convinced the public that the destruction in the suburbs should be viewed as a protest against exclusion and racism.” “I think that the lofty idea of ‘the war on racism’ is gradually turning into a hideously false ideology. And this anti-racism will be for the 21st century what communism was for the 20th century: A source of violence.”

I tried to make a reservation for your 2 bedroom suite with a lake view (at the Chicago location) to the tune of around a half million dollars and the reservations representative asked me if I knew about your "Gathering policy." Apparently, only the 6 registered guests for the room are the only people allowed to access the room at all. As the room was for a celebration for a friend's wedding and we planned on doing gifts and snacks at the hotel prior to going out for dinner and drinks, I had no choice but to cancel.

While the adult life he described to you was certainly true, his background was far from the one he claimed. If you would be interested in further information about this sad and, I think, somewhat troubled man, please feel free to contact me.
I’ve got the content, now who is going to read it? First off, who is my target audience? Who is the blog for? I will admit, this blog is selfishly for me. I want to learn more about blogging, and about the blog world, but in my journey I hope to leave a path for those to follow me. My target audience then is the new bloggers to come, but I do not think I am limited to that, I think that good lessons can resonate with even the most experienced blogger. Regardless of your audience you have to reach them somehow, and for how to do that I asked Jay (yet again), and in good old fashion Jay style he didn’t tell me. He did however give me a whole bunch of words to look up on google. Words like Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Google Analytics, Google Juice, Google Webmaster Tools, blog traffic, blog pingback, and “using social media to drive blog traffic.” My research into these topics made the box grow enormously, and I found I was in way over my head. In fact, Jay informed me he attended numerous seminars spanning many days to learn about such topics. I have absolutely no intention of putting together a seminar, or outlining in detail the technicalities of everything I’ve learned. Instead I’ll encourage you to do the same thing I did. Google those words, follow my links, read up on them, and if you one day get the chance; sit in on a webinar or seminar on the topcis. When you are not a professional, it’s best to just point at one (Oh Look! There’s Jay!).
To kick things off I thought I'd start with a recipe for homemade Nutella. I've actually made two different versions. One can be found at the Oh Nuts blog--that recipe uses melted chocolate and condensed milk, and has a smoother, fudgier texture. That blog post has step-by-step photos for making Nutella, if you're new to this sort of thing.

That’s a slab of a tree which has been chopped down in order to study the rings inside, a study referred to as dendrochronology*. Each of these rings represents a specific period of time (oftentimes each ring an individual year), and though I have no idea how the hell to put specific numbers and dates with these rings, there are scientists who can do just that. To a tree, time is gathered in the rings as it grows outward, and I feel there is metaphorical significance which can be observed in this. The rings in the middle are the oldest, and each subsequent circle moving outward embodies a specific period of movement toward the future. The important difference in this illustration, however, is the smaller rings which represent the past are contained within each subsequent ring, so it turns into a series of pasts building upon each other, bleeding into one another, etc.

﻿Today, surprisingly, was a good day; bitter-sweet, but good. I was able to enjoy myself, reflect and feel the flow of love going in and out of my heart. I spent a good amount of time at the cemetery today. And during my earlier visit I journaled. I could have sat there all day. The sense of clarity I felt today was comforting and I realized today, that I am a good mother to both my children. The following were my thoughts as they flowed from my heart to my pen.
appy happy birthday BFF!!! Today is Suzanne’s bday and the cmc was in cahoots to do something nice for Su…well she is a nice gal and deserve all the pretty things in the world LOL. I hope you are having a sweet unforgettable time in Vegas BABY!!! LOL.

I have heard a few “interesting” comments since I started my weight loss but the one I am getting the most traction out of came this weekend. AN old friend, maybe a about 2-3 inches shorter than I am, asked how much weight I had lost and what I weigh now. I told him I had lost about 63 pounds and was right around 242 pounds. His comment: “Wow, you have lost all that weight and you still weigh more than me!” I just smiled. What else could I do? I am still chuckling….

With reference to my photo in the layout, I did not realize when I was actually snapped by the camera but when I pray, I really focus and I pray for the best of everything. I believe in God and I believe in prayer - a lot. And I believe that we are not supposed to pray only when we are in trouble - people say don't pray when it rains if you do not pray when the sun shines. I believe God always hear and answer our prayers, even if the answer is sometimes no :)
In a brief return to political matters... What won’t the candidates be discussing during this election season? Campaign finance, surveillance, patent reform…are among a few issues that candidates are sure to avoid. What else....? This mini-slide show shows just a few.

There’s really no way to put a positive spin on this story. The obama administration got caught trying to sneak through approval of a disastrous & dangerous business scheme directly on the heels of hefty campaign contributions from a financier obama & Co. have been cozy with for years. Expect obama to be subpoenaed but refuse to appear, and the FCC to quietly revoke the waiver as ever more Federal agencies and GPS-related industry groups join the pile-on.
When came home from our trip we were delighted to find our garden getting ready to break out in colorful flowers and hopeful buds.

So, here is the most recent picture of me. I am definitely getting the bump now and it feels nice to actually look a little more pregnant rather than just feeling pregnant. Things have been going great and on March 5, Tagg and I found out that we are having a little girl! We are both so excited! We already have a nursery that is painted perfectly for a little girl....Score! Don't have to make any changes there:)
On 11th May 2007 - the day after announcing that he would formally resign from his job of Prime Minister on June 27th - the Mail carried an article about how people age. It had the title Don't worry Tony...None of us is getting younger. These are the pictures that were at the head of the story.
What do I want for Christmas this year? I want that spirit to come back with a big Bam-a-lammo. I can’t force it, so I’m asking you all, anyone of you at all, to help me find that Christmas-Holiday Doodledeedahday. I know it’s somewhere. I must have just misplaced it in a corner, under a pile of sweaters, in the sock drawer, in the hollowed out tree, behind the dresser, under the couch . . . somewhere, it’s here somewhere.
You will see that you have made changes to others and influenced them just by being that love. It resonates and interacts with all. Negative will fade and positive will be strengthened. Dark will be transmuted into light. In working on your self-love you will bring great benefits to all and first of all your own being. So try to ponder on what it is that you not like or hate in being you. Write it down. Look at it. Feel it in you and say it is loved and will ever be loved by you. Feel that Self Love and know it is part of you.
My son is not like that. He’s intelligent and thoughtful. He’ll protect an animal that is hurt, a child that is being bullied. My son is a critical thinker. We’ve worked hard at making sure he knows right from wrong, good from bad, and ignorance and intolerance from well, simply knowing better than that.
Mr. Sim has spent this past year W-A-I-T-I-N-G for school to start! He and the Bubbs are so close in age and have done pretty much everything together that the separation was a bit hard on him. In other news, it has been nice for the Buns because the two of them have become pretty good friends, playing together every morning after seminary while I rest a little before the Buggs gets up.
But ultimately, Prokofiev remained a Romantic at heart, moved by folk idioms, ethnic influences, myth, and a commitment to love as the foundation for human relations. Prokofiev wrote that he saw “Cinderella not only as a fairy-tale character but also as a real person who thinks, moves, suffers, and rejoices like one of ourselves.” This musical play between reality and fantasy, innocence and adult perspective is an ideal setting for a classic coming-of-age tale in which a disadvantaged young woman, armed with kindness and beauty, must find her rightful place in a cruel, dangerous, and oppressive world.

Everyone can pshaw me. I have a complex about being treated as younger than I am. I will say, I know I look younger, which is fine in social situations and not an issue for me. Usually this bugs me most in a work situation. It is getting more fun to say I'm in my late thirties, but still, I get the "you're still young" statement at work more times than I can count. In my twenties, I thought, fair enough, but I do have ideas I would like to try. In my early thirties, sure, I've only been out of grad school for 5-10 years, I need to get some time under my belt. But now I'm starting to get a bit peeved. How many years should one expect to be in the work force to get respect for experience? So I keep thinking that maybe 40 is the magical number. That this is the time that people will say, "Ok, yeah, she's been around the block a few times." On the other hand, I have always worked with people older than me, so I guess they deserve to lord their years of experience over me. But I would like them to acknowledge that I have spent enough time in my business to warrant a nod of recognition that I do know what I am doing, on occasion.

A source of electricity like this is important even in the capital city of Kampala, where we have rotating blackouts known affectionately as “load shedding,” during which the power is frequently off in 8- to 12-hour rotating cycles throughout the city.

I wish I had something more exciting to show but I'm still suffering with 'artist's block'.

I've been putting together some unfinished quilt tops and was surprised to find I have 4 nearly completed single quilts! I do love the piecing but I lose interest once I've put the tops together and it takes years before I quilt and bind them! Next winter... they will definitely be finished and on the beds by next winter!

Since I started working in my current job, however, I’ve started to understand the ins-and-outs of expressing thanks. Nonprofit organizations are heavily dependent on the goodwill and generosity of others, and I’m reminded every day how lucky we are to be located in a community like Rome. My passion for expressing thanks these days stems from that acknowledgment. Gratitude is something that every organization should embrace. We should thank people for their engagement and involvement far more often than we ask them for assistance.

Ok, back to my list of impossible things! I've had the idea for a while of writing down my bucket list, or things I would like to do before I die. What prompted me lately was one of my friends had started a thing called the Blog of Impossible Things, which is basically a list of things that you feel are impossible for yourself to do…..and you do them. Brit and I both did this, and they are pretty similar but not really haha. I can't wait to get started too! Some of the things I wrote down I feel really are impossible for me, especially the physical ones. I feel like it will be an ongoing thing, but here's what I have so far:
We then cruised back to the pier, had a spot of lunch and took the bus back to Ha Noi. We all really enjoyed our time on Ha Long Bay in the Chinese Junk Boat, but the scenery wasn’t really new to us after seeing southern Thailand and the more sparse islands around there, so it would have probably been more impressive if we had been here first. Saying that it was very pretty and would definitely recommend seeing it, but if you had to choose between the two I would say Krabi was nicer!

The flowers were made from white card that I stamped with a Wendy Vecchi text stamp and then I used the Paper Artsy Scallop Flower die. I assembled the flowers and then used my new Melting Pot to coat them with UTEE to make porcelain flowers. For the leaves I blended Weathered Wood DI over some white card stock and then screwed it up to break the fibres. Then I used DI direct to the card and then ironed it on the reverse side. I used the Tattered Leaves die to cut the leaves out. The text is a Wendy Vecchi stamp that I've masked off and stamped each line separately.

I am concerned that St Johns church owns half of our city square, and should they wish to do so in the future, could put new buildings there, which would mean that our city square could disappear as the central focus of the city. It is therefore essential not to erect substantial buildings on the City owned triangle of it, to ensure there will always be a Kings Square.

The correct pace for a half-marathon based on fitness level is a deceptively comfortable one, and my biggest fear going into the race was going out at "only 6:40" pace, and then staggering in the last few miles. So the day before, I drove over my local high school track, and ran a 6:48 to get a get a good feel for target pace. At one point, I ever close my eyes while running, just to focus on rhythm and cadence. Then, I also did a few 40 yard stride-outs in my bare feet, which as I found out in a recent tempo work-out helped focus to form and kept my feet feeling fresh.

The aromas follow through in taste with some added spiciness and the flavour of fried fruit to match the characteristics of the traditional Clootie Dumpling. I lost the taste of banana that was so present in the smell, which is a little disappointing but there is enough going on with this beer to keep me interested. Something that I definitely didn’t expect from this beer (judging by the packaging and description) was that it would be a really easy drinking beer. It’s has a low abv. (4.2%) and is light enough in flavour to be a session ale but it is definitely more interesting that your standard IPA or light ale. The spiciness is kept in the aftertaste and in that way reminds me again of a ginger beer.
I do, of course, have a couple of gripes. First, I do wish Brookfield had been a bit more explicit about pointing out that trying out just one of these critical lenses would be a perfectly good place to start. He does emphasise frequently that the process of critical reflection is slow and hard, and involves a lot of resistance from yourself and others as you start to discover things you’d really rather ignore. However, a bit more reassurance that you can start critical reflection with one tiny thing and build from there would not have gone amiss. (I am delighted that he pointed out that changing the requirements of a course halfway through, regardless of whether you think you are responding to student demand and needs, is unlikely to end well – I do sometimes get the sense that some writers forget that radically revising a course mid-stream often just isn’t practical, and major revisions of the syllabus might be best left to the next time you prepare to teach the course.)

"If it is a divided highway, then there is no requirement to pull over for the other direction," Goodrich says. "The dividing median can be painted or raised.

7. Follow the money. Very few people speak without financial motive or incentive. The casino companies are pouring money into the campaigns and slush funds of Florida politicians. So are the existing tourism businesses that don't want the competition. In general, there are some legitimate arguments on both sides. But don't expect those points to come from those getting paid to make them.

"From what I saw, the players are looking forward to revisiting the things we did well last year and making improvements on the things that we didn't do well," said Shurmur. "You get to work with some of the new coaches and some of the new players. For me, I just have a much better view of what our team is and the areas we need to improve in to get ourselves in a position to play in the playoffs and compete to play in the big game. And I think that's what we're looking to do."

Perhaps nothing more accurately summed up the night than a Lakers highlight-reel play late in the third quarter. Matthews was dribbling the ball on the perimeter when he inexplicably slipped and fumbled the ball away. Former Blazers point guard Steve Blake scooped the ball up for the Lakers and streaked to the other end of the court for a two-on-none fast break.

That's where the Avengers can help.
Although Shires no longer has a Texas address, a dusty High Plains breeze blows straight through "Carrying Lightning." She writes poetically of old fencing and bailing wire, dogwood and mimosa trees, and ceiling fans that can’t seem to keep pace with the heat. Her love stories seem to be set in farmhouses under the roaring Lone Star sun; it’s here where her characters surrender to desire and yearn to break free. Many of her narrators are struggling against their restraints and racing toward abandon and the promise of passion. On "She Let Go of Her Kite," Shires’ protagonist is literally taken by the wind; it’s with violently mixed emotions that she allows her prized and lovingly patched possession to get swept up into the Texas sky. ("Carrying Lightning" will be released on May 3.)
Sightseeing trip: It's about five blocks up from Lovers Point Park, with cute cottages from the town's Methodist camp days in between.

Many vegan dishes, however, are already beloved; we eat fruit salad, peanut butter and jelly, beans and rice, eggplant in marinara sauce. The problem faced by many of us - brought up as we were with plates whose center was filled with a piece of an animal - is in imagining less-traditional vegan dishes that are creative, filling, interesting and not especially challenging to either put together or enjoy.

Journalists often say that Zé “disappeared” in the 1980s, but he says he continued to perform in the state of São Paulo. Zé’s reemergence came as a result of a surprise call from David Byrne in 1990. Byrne, best known as the frontman for Talking Heads, was starting up a new label, Luaka Bop, and found one of Zé’s records on a trip to Brazil. Luaka Bop issued a collection of Zé’s songs and then several other discs, helping Zé find new audiences worldwide.
Lost Coast Brewery (motto: "Brewed fresh in the Humboldt Nation"), also in Eureka, dispenses pub food and such house beers as Great White, with overtones of coriander and citrus. It's also one of dozens of venues that hosts live music on weekends — jazz, blues or folk — appealing equally to sophisticated ladies in gauzy white ensembles and guys whose beards have grown dreadlocks.
On the other side of the debate, an AT&T executive has praised the Google-Verizon agreement as a positive step. Charter's general counsel, Gregory Doody, said in an e-mail that he was encouraged by attempts to forge a consensus but didn't want to comment on the specifics of the deal.

Groups involved in the referendum effort, however, do not want lawmakers to repeal HB 194. The referendum must go on, they said, because the people have said they want to vote on the law. Plus, worries persist among these groups that GOP lawmakers will slip provisions into new legislation that would make it harder for minorities and poor people to vote - the root of their objections to HB 194.

But the poor bedraggled old thing, light blue as I remember, would wobble out to the ranch on weekends, wheezing and groaning. We could eat chilies and ride horses and sleep outside on the mesa, and the war would be a world away. The Rambler's crankcase had to be constantly refilled. Ah, but this was in west Texas, where oil and gas were cheap.
Lawrence's literary scene has been better-known for its past  early home of Langston Hughes; final home of William S. Burroughs  than its present. The city's current lit-minded contingent of readers and writers wants that to change.

Our founding fathers understood society inherently contains strong anti-democratic forces and provided us with a remedy in these times of crisis. We can amend our constitution and right our democracy. To do so is as American as America itself. We have done it before, 12 times in the 20th century, three of them overturning unpopular U.S. Supreme Court decisions.
One has to wonder how the male-dominated church expects to survive as anything more than a men's club with the dedicated women expected to be their servants.
Robinson's pleading voice and the smooth Miracles background vocals are so perfect, it's hard to tell where they end and the string section begins. The driving bass and drum make it a classic love song.
"There were times when I was sitting out and going through the process of talking to different doctors and players, where some of the answers were that I may not be able to play again," Roy said. "So it got to that point where I thought about it, but I always said once I had the surgery that I wasn't going to worry about it anymore. But there was a moment that I did think, 'Well, is the option that I don't play no more?'
Pitt argues since the Big East allowed West Virginia and TCU to exit the conference immediately that Pitt is no longer required to abide by the 27-month waiting period.

Senate Republicans refused to confirm anyone to head the new agency, demanding changes in its governance first. They said the Dodd-Frank bill put too much unbridled power in a single director, a recipe for abuse. GOP senators, who had kind words for Cordray personally, said they wanted a five-member oversight board and auditors who could examine the agency's work.
An even bigger challenge might be finding ways to modernize the Dome, at least by the latest NFL standards. The newest, glitziest stadiums have broken the billion-dollar mark and feature amenities the Dome would be hard-pressed to match.

The important words are “decades old.” The conventional wisdom is that the much-reviled Citizens United decision opened the way for sugar daddies Foster Friess and Sheldon Adelson to spend megabucks furthering the candidacies of Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, respectively. They do this through hefty donations to "super PACs," taking advantage of a federal appeals court decision that followed and cited Citizens United. Their largesse has inspired a generic lament about the outsize role wealthy individuals can play in elections.
That celebratory Kool & the Gang vibe translates across genres. The band, which last released an album in 2007, has opened for rock acts before, including Meat Loaf and Def Leppard, and last year wound up on the bill at Glastonbury, one of England's biggest rock festivals.

One of the largest pieces is a room-sized installation by Wheeler that messes with your senses: He has outfitted a gallery with more than 200 feet of recessed neon tubing in such a way that an entire wall dissolves into a hazy, penumbra-like effect. It is a re-creation of a piece from 1968.

Most days, though, what constitutes “old” is “a moving target,” Edstrom said. She has friends her age with kids at home; others with grandchildren. As a current Ph.D. student, Edstrom enjoys the advantages of having acquired more life experience than the average student, along with the disadvantages of taking a graduate-level statistics course when her high school math classes are but a dim memory.
But he added an asterisk: "We're expecting that he won't (miss time), but to say that that can't happen, I can't say that. We feel that he can get ready to play, but bottom line is we'll have to wait and see what happens."
“Patty will play,” McMillan said. “I think I really want to get back to Patty in that lineup for a few minutes. After watching Rudy and Brandon play, you take away from what those guys are capable of doing when you don’t have a point guard with them. I think we can go that way for some short minutes, but they are more effective when they have the ball reversed to them and not initiating the offense.”

But the Blues got exactly what they needed to recover with an early goal in the third. Again, penalties were involved, as Edmonton's Corey Potter went to the box 17 seconds in. The Blues took just two seconds to make good, with Pietrangelo powering a shot past a screened Dubnyk. It was Pietrangelo's sixth, cutting the deficit to 3-2.
The lesson buried in watching the Blazers play up-tempo and look like more fun is too difficult to miss. Remember, they're more enjoyable to watch, but not better. A Roy-led team would crush this No. 8-seed product that is bringing smiles to faces.
Hallead said the proposals were contingent upon the withdrawal of the layoff-and recall provision. In the current state budget environment, she said, that was "not an option for the district."

That is why, in what is a truly pathetic example of political opportunism, McIntosh's campaign dug through every grant the Women's Fund has given out over the years. Think about that: Brooks has volunteered her time and effort to the local nonprofit group that tries to improve and save lives, and McIntosh's campaign saw that as an opportunity to go after her -- even if it meant politicizing an organization that seeks to do nothing more than good work. In politics circa 2012, is nothing off-limits?
"It's about parenthood," said screenwriter Eric Heisserer ("Final Destination 5" and "The Thing"), who is making his directing debut with "Hours."

The Cavs have not won since Dec. 18, 47 days ago. What does a win look like, anyway? Is it bigger than a breadbox? The thing came wrapped in confetti falling from the rafters, as I recall. Used to happen a lot, at least until the spring when the games really counted.

Orvieto has narrow alleyways and streets made out of volcanic tufa winding up to the 13th century duomo on the crag. With its glistening gold facade and Signorelli's visionary paintings of the "Day of Judgment," Orvieto's cathedral is one of Italy's most important Gothic specimens. Because the town also boasts 50 restaurants and 500 sommeliers for 21,000 inhabitants, the traveler's material as well as spiritual needs are well catered to.
"The specific example used by the attorney general to support these allegations -- that a father was approached for payment prior to his child being provided care -- was in fact, the opposite," the company said.

We accommodated his request, and the father expressed his appreciation for our assistance."

2010 Starmont Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc ($18, 13.9%): This offshoot of Merryvale reaches up and down the length of the valley for fruit to balance out the flavors in this larger-production bottling. Fermented in a mix of mostly older oak and steel, it comes out a touch edgy and tart. But the cat's-business scents are a shout-out to New Zealand fans, backed up by pretty snap pea and tart peach. Zesty and fulfilling.

Yet Becker is not a passionless robot.

Christopher Guerra, an artist and Occupy Wall Street protester from Newark, N.J., said the job losses aren't necessarily bad.
“I’m always a defender first, but when the game opens up hopefully I can attack the space and help Dane a little bit more, because whenever he got the ball in the first game they always had two guys covering him,” Solli said. “It was almost impossible for him to outrun his fullback, so if I can make it like a two-against-two challenge it will be easier for him. He has a great skill with his pace, and if you can get him into the back space that will open up the game and give us a lot of options.”

A spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Health says people became sick from April 22 to June 26.
The same, of course, could be said of narrative, which is, at the most basic level, an attempt to impose order on the chaos of experience. That adds another layer of tension to the collection, since stories need some kind of resolution even when what they record is unresolved. For the most part, Doerr does an excellent job of balancing these intentions, creating work that is open-ended yet nuanced, avoiding false connections or epiphanies. The narrator of "The River Nemunas," a teenage girl who moves from Kansas to Lithuania to live with her grandfather after her parents die of cancer, learns that it never gets easier, that the pain of absence is perhaps the only thing that doesn't dissipate. "Lots of things fade away," she thinks, "but ghosts like these don't, heartbreak like this doesn't."

Frustrated by Christie’s rhetoric that the tax would hurt small business owners along with the wealthy, Democrats devised what they thought was a compromise — tax true millionaires, and use the money for senior and disabled taxpayers who needed it most. Christie, who never intended to sign any such tax, was angered more by the timing of the Democrats’ announcement: a half hour before he officially rolled out his "Cap 2.5" property tax reform agenda that opened up a second front in his war with lawmakers. He wasn’t happy with Sweeney springing it on him, and in private Christie made sure he knew it.

What about Little’s drops early in the season and what's your take on that? “I think the more you get comfortable with what you’re doing the actual skills that you need to perform become smoother, the game slows down and then again, it’s in college and in high school, with all due respect, there’s not a lot of defenses that get up in your face and challenge every move you make as a receiver. You see a lot of zone coverage, you see alto of free access. In pro football, they’re right up on you and I think that takes a little bit of getting use to for a receiver and that may be what you’re talking about. As you get more and more use to what we’re doing, where you’re supposed to be then I think catching the football then becomes a little bit more natural.”

Aaron Cosby (5 pts., 7 reb.): Seton Hall got a nice bonus of seven boards from the freshman, but again, not much offense. We know he can shoot and score, but he still seems timid to get involved. He was 2-of-6 against Saint Peter's and knocked down a 3, but seemed to disappear too often.

A: You have to understand from Microsoft's, I think from the guys at Microsoft's perspective, and I would agree, they've had some successes like Connect but they're clearly behind in some key areas that are clearly the key battlegrounds of the future like the phone and the tablet, and so they're coming from behind there, and so they have to do their best to catch up. I'm certainly rooting for them to do better, and they know that, but since they're playing catch-up they've got a heck of a challenge. I try to give them my best advice and I wish them the best, but in technology it's always a challenge to come from behind. Sometimes you can pull it off and sometimes you wind up with a lesser market share than if you'd been earlier into the game. I could go on for hours and hours about particular things, but I'm not sure that this is what you want to talk about ....

The high point was "On and Off and to and Fro," a long and varied but still well-organized ensemble that involved clarinet, vibraphone and cello along with three electronic megaphones; a solo cadenza for siren sounds and feedback was just one tour de force among many.
The owners of 98,000 homes in Baltimore receive at least some benefit from the homestead credit this year. The remaining 25,000 get nothing, either because their home values have plummeted or, like Burdick, they bought within the past few years and have had no increases to cap. Renters are also on the losing end of the homestead equation — landlords aren't eligible for the break and pass the cost of their higher tax bills on to their tenants.

To some Americans, this agenda will seem ambitious. To others, it may seem frightening. But House leaders believe their main risk is appearing too timid to their own members. Even if this three-part strategy proceeds with efficiency and success, in two years it will result in a budget freeze, an unsuccessful guerrilla campaign against health reform and the bare beginnings of the entitlement debate. Will Tea Party revolutionaries view this as victory? Will they be tempted by the Ross Perot option -- a third-party movement that would increase the odds of Obama's re-election?

DeCastro will be making pro bowl year after year and the Bengals chose Zeitler instead...and they had the opportunity to add an absolutely dynamic receiver next to Green, but they chose to draft the average corner in Kirkpatrick and then take Sanu later to make up for it.

We need to be careful to distinguish how people respond to fear mongering and who is spreading the fears.

The strategy didn't work even if many of Bryant's field goals came on deep jumpers. But they were good looks for Bryant because, well, he's Kobe, and he created enough space off efficient jabs and pump fakes. One time, Bryant stepped back with a Dirk Nowitzki-like one-legged fade-away. On another play, Bryant pump-faked, drew a foul on Arron Afflalo and sank a 16-footer that bounced off the rim and dropped through the net. Bryant also attacked aggressively in the post.

muckduck: The Ducks can now begin their dominance as an official ELITE team with that 2012 Rose Bowl win and DAT is going to be a HUGE part of this unreal offense next year!!! Samurai7: Besides the two long runs for touchdowns untouched, DAT picked up a key first down beating a defender well short of the first down marker, which set up the winning touchdown. Also, He and Barner were the "gunners" on the punt with 22 seconds left going downfield making the fair catch necessary and creating a long field! hermtownhomy: DAT definitely stood out, but that does not mean he should be singled out as the only reason they won. He is scary fast. Probably the fastest player in football right now and we all look forward to the future with him, but his two runs were not necessarily turning points in the game. They still could have gone on to score if those two runs hadn't happened. True turning points in the game were the interception and fumble recovery. I just don't agree with JC's point here that DAT was the reason they won. It was a team effort. RipCityDroHead85: De'Ant was prolly the MVP, I'd agree, but LaMike and Darren had pretty good games too, along with Tuinei. As far as that best duck ever, I don't know if i'd be heaping that much praise on him just yet, LaMike made a key block that sprung one of his long ones. No mention of the best duck rb ever out there blocking for another rb. portlandchiro1: I agree with the praise heaped on De'Anthony, but lets not get carried away. This was a full team win with many stars contributing. Where would Oregon have been without the two forced turnovers from the defense-including the unbelievable interception by Kiko Alonzo? How about the catches by Tunei, the grueling runs by LaMichael James, the touchdown catch by Barner, and on and on on. This was a team win and there are many heroes. Bravo to all the Ducks!!!

The Sept. 21 and 22 shows at MetLife Stadium conflict with another major music event taking place in the Garden State that weekend: All Tomorrow's Parties in Asbury Park. There is not likely to be too much overlap between the ATP audience and the Springsteen crowd, but the Boss has been reaching many younger listeners with "Wrecking Ball" -- which made its debut atop the Billboard 200 -- and his star turn at South By Southwest has helped re-establish him as a musician whose moves tastemakers cannot ignore. Don't be surprised if many ATP fans find themselves torn.

Increasingly, the world belongs to those collecting capital gains. They're the ones who demanded and got massive tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 on the false promise that the gains would "trickle down" to everyone else in the form of more jobs and better wages. They're now advocating austerity economics on the false premise that cuts in public spending -- including education, infrastructure and safety nets -- will generate more "confidence" and "certainty" among lenders and investors, and also lead to more jobs and better wages.

Even if the U.S. economy (as well as President Barack Obama's re-election campaign) survives Europe's recession, we have our own big dose of austerity economics coming in less than eight months -- when drastic spending cuts are scheduled to kick in, as well as tax increases on the middle class. But the U.S. economy isn't healthy enough to bear this burden. That means a double-dip recession.

Wendell Maxey: You can always count on Armon for two things: to be real with you and be ready to shoot when he gets in the game. Can't blame the guy for having a quick trigger with the mop up minutes he played for Nate McMillan to close out the season. Going forward, I think you bring Armon back. He's a good size guard with an aggressive drive for the game. The smooth lefty showed some growth signs during his stint with the Idaho Stampede and is still learning how to run a team and play the right way (read: cut down on the turnovers youngster). Besides, you have to bring Johnson back. Who else is going to come running and cheering off the bench with Patty Mills?

But when a person aggressively goes after another in the way that Zimmerman and Browning did, and someone dies, it ought to be a crime. If it's not, the Florida Legislature needs to fix it.
"I think it's hard to tell who's the 1 and 2 line, so it's hard to have a matchup," Hitchcock said. "They have one line that plays against top lines. We have one line that plays against top lines. They have a No. 2 line that they don't care who they play against because they're good. So I don't see it as a defined matchup. There's some individual line matchups that are going to go on, but I think it's more focus on your own team."

It won't be easy, even against the 15-43 Kings. Aldridge needs to bust out of his two-game malaise, but tonight he faces the team that held him to nine points Jan. 24, thanks mostly to excellent defense by center Samuel Dalembert, who will surely get the same assignment tonight.

• How did this happen? Here's The New York Times' Howard Beck's description of Shumpert's injury: "Shumpert will have surgery in New York and will be out six to eight months, possibly cutting into the start of next season... The injury occurred in the middle of the third quarter, when Shumpert was dribbling the ball across midcourt. He lost the ball as he dribbled behind his back, from left to right, then appeared to twist his knee as he turned to regain it... Shumpert immediately crumpled to the court, clutching his knee. He was carried off minutes later by his teammates Josh Harrellson and Jerome Jordan."

In general, low-budget films stand to benefit the most proportionately by winning because they have received less hype and exposure, the report said. Last year’s winner, "The Hurt Locker," reaped $17 million in box office receipts and cost just $11 million to make.

McConnell said LaSalle addressed both issues within 30 days, and that the jail subsequently gained accreditation from the American Correctional Association. The ACA sets voluntary national standards for correctional facilities; companies often seek accreditation to show they meet such standards. For example, Management and Training Corp., which operates Arizona's Kingman prison, sought and received ACA accreditation this year after correcting security flaws and other problems that contributed to the escape of three prisoners there a year ago.
"There was one week that was very slow, but Toyota has come out with some very good incentives since then," Ganley said. He added that all of the cars on his lot are for sale again, so he's not facing the inventory issues that many dealers had in late January and the first part of this month.

Though corn and beans are better-known Mexican natives, squash predates them by several thousand years; Maya people domesticated several varieties of squash as early as 8000 B.C. Oils from these seeds were the main source of dietary fat before the Spanish introduced beef and pork. Though the native plants included cucumber, zucchini, patty pan and butternut squash, great quantities of pumpkin — la calabaza grande — defines the Yucatán diet even today. Toasted, ground pumpkin seeds still appear on menus even more than the flesh.

The main floor is, well, a bit breathtaking. Think NYC's Grand Central Station's Main Concourse in miniature, reimagined as an agora of gastronomy. There's a swanky, glittery bar awash in inventive cocktails, and an 18-seat chef's table with front row views of the kitchen's culinary choreography. (A "Crop Shop," offering produce from the fields and products from the kitchen, is coming soon.)
Fraley, who entered the meet with a mark two feet higher than her closest competition, said she was confident in her ability to win gold again.
We've never quite been believers of UCLA at any point this season. And in spite of Sparty's failings (there have been a lot of them), we did pick them in the preseason as a Final Four team. The fact that Team Izzo seems to be finally turning the corner only encourages us to stay with the decision. Michigan State 62-54.

Ruby arrived in horrible condition. She was completely emaciated, just skin and bones. Thanks to the loving care of her foster family, Ruby is more healthy and beautiful than we ever could have imagined. Ruby is a smart lady and has already learned the commands sit, lay down, lay down over there, paw, kennel up, and hugs. She is working on her loose leash walking too. Ruby gets along well with dogs, cats and even has met chickens and rabbits through a cage and is pretty much uninterested in them! Ruby adores children. She is nervous with men and her foster family is working to teach her that they are okay. Ruby appreciates it if a man leaves her alone at first and gives her a few minutes to warm up. It just takes her a bit of time! She has quickly learned to love and respect the man of the house in her foster home. Ruby would do well in a quieter home, as she is a quieter type of dog. Gentle corrections do the trick for Ruby, and a harsh correction would upset her feelings. Ruby is a true GEM and deserves a loving home! She will continue to stay in foster care learning and growing while she waits for the perfect family to find her!

"Kinect Star Wars" is proudly in the former category, and the faithful should run screaming like it's a "Star Wars Holiday Special" sequel. At least that notoriously cheesy 1978 TV program wasn't interactive. "Kinect Star Wars" has a dancing mini-game that is bad bordering on surreal, replacing modern pop standards with "Star Wars"-themed lyrics as characters including Han Solo perform ridiculous dance moves.
The company has been on the defensive with Wall Street after losing $3.14 billion in 2011 and because of the years-long decline in sales at its Sears and Kmart stores. Revenue at U.S. stores open at least a year, a key indicator of retailers' performance, fell 2.2 percent last year.

“You could take the average fan and say: ‘You’ve got a minute, walk through the front door of the Yankee clubhouse and, on the same day, walk through the Diamondback clubhouse," Towers said. "You can’t say anything, just evaluate what’s going on, walk through the room, down the steps, into the dugout and out, and you tell me which one’s a winner and which one’s not.’ Even if they had their name tags covered, it’d be easy. Those guys are the winners, and those guys are the losers.”

Gregg, a retired lawyer, and Peter, a college librarian in Gainesville, Fla., drove to Everglades City a day early to claim our camping spots. Sam and I met them at the Ivey House, a historic B&B that served as our staging ground. Peter had been unable to secure our first-choice camping spot -- a so-called chickee platform on stilts about 8 feet above the water in one of the inland creeks, about a 10-mile paddle from the ranger station. So we chose a beach site on an island encouragingly named Jewel Key, due west, dead into the wind.

The Oklahoma native has said she's proud of her family ties to Cherokee and Delaware tribes — a heritage she said she learned through stories passed down from older family members.
They've all been around the blockbuster block, individually or in smaller combinations. Now this group of a half-dozen heroic comic-book characters fights a dastardly villain on land, air and into outer space. But they also amusingly tussle among themselves. It's that last squabbling that makes for the most fun.
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials at their last meeting expressed concerns that the weakening job market might hold back the economic recovery.
But then Fry is better at pointing out the contradictions in his character than anyone else. Chief among these is the discrepancy between his unflappable public-school English manner and his jangling sense of himself as a "Jewish mongrel with an addictive self-destructive streak." A gay man who infamously outed himself as a celibate during his long sexless period, Fry, like Wilde, is a consummate inside-outsider—a societal position unmatched for comic surveillance.
On Tuesday, the corps opened the Gavins Point Dam, near Yankton, S.D., to five times normal flow because the massive flood-control reservoirs on the upper Missouri are at brimful, compliments of heavy snowmelt and record rain in Montana and the Dakotas.

But problems loom in Columbus. Democrats fear the political clout of teachers unions. And for some Republicans, anything that demands positive results from their deep-pocketed contributors in the charter school crowd makes them skittish.

The district's intentions were good. Not only were too few students attempting the so-called A through G curriculum — a required series of high school English, math, social studies and other courses required for entry to California's public four-year colleges and universities — but the numbers attempting it were much lower among disadvantaged black and Latino students. Before the policy was adopted, many school administrators assumed these students were incapable of or uninterested in a future in college and steered them toward a less rigorous course of study.

Photo equipment. Keep it simple, but bring some extra digital cards and an extra battery or two. In Yosemite Valley, you can buy extra cards at the Ansel Adams Gallery and at the store, but they’re expensive and sometimes not in stock. I usually pack two tripods: a larger, heavier-duty tripod that can extend and support my telephoto lenses and a smaller one that can be easily strapped to my backpack. A cable release is also a must. Some of the exposures are long, and you don’t want to touch the camera or cause any vibration that will make the picture look out of focus.

What a great place, this secluded little corner with this understated bistro, 1 year old this month, and many months removed from a bumpy start that made me question whether it even stood a chance.

With the election of Obama four years ago, some people mistakenly believe America is now a post-racial country, according to Cathy Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Chicago. But many young black men remain the targets of the racism that still exists, she said.
The rebuke of Ryan is a credit to the Catholic leaders, because they are displaying their doctrinal consistency even as politicians embrace church teachings selectively. Republicans hailed the Catholic bishops when they were opposing the Obama administration's policy to expand contraceptive coverage; likewise, they cite the church's opposition to abortion. But these same lawmakers have little interest in the church's position against the death penalty or its opposition to the Arizona immigration law.

Events like the Pakistan shrine bombing, which killed eight people, of course take their toll at once. But religious intimidation, too, unleashes waves that weaken whole societies.

I thought we couldn't afford matching furniture or Hummel figurines, and that my mom was too tired to create those snow-scenes on the windows. But I grew up to realize that my mother had something better than money; she had taste. She painted and sketched and made clothes so beautiful that after her memorial service, one of my sister's friends wept as she told me about the elegance of the French seams my mother put inside a formal she'd sewn for her as a gift. Today, years after she's gone, my brother, sister and I have my mom's paintings on the walls of our homes.

Through his first 10⅓ innings this season, Santana (1-1, 4.76 ERA) evoked hope by peppering inefficient appearances with glimmers of past greatness. Tonight was different, a full-out collapse that ended after 55 pitches (35 strikes). His shortest start with the Mets (7-4) before tonight was a three-inning, nine-run catastrophe at Yankee Stadium on June 14, 2009. This latest performance elicited more concern, considering his tenuous condition.
"I just think our offense has been very ordinary early in the game."
James Johnson, 23, of Portland, said that he has no source of money other than a part-time janitor job to pay for his studies as a sophomore physics major at PSU. So he's relied on loans.

This is the first in a four-part series of feature stories the St. Charles Journal is doing about local farmers.

Farris, a defensive end, said he was caught off-guard.
Most readers know Natalie Babbitt for her fantasy, "Tuck Everlasting." This story, set in a small town in Ohio in the 1960s, has no magic. Joe Casimir, ready for junior high, has always lived with his grandmother, but he's packed off to Aunt Myra while Gran recovers from hip replacement. Though the setting is carefully dated (no Internet, no cellphones), the realities of Joe's life -- the way he doesn't talk about his dreams for life, the excitement of finding new friends (including Beatrice and her dog, Rover) -- speak directly to children today. The moon, changing but in a dependable way, presides over Midville. Not even the richest man in town can buy that. Good for family talk.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics U.S. Department of Labor (BLS/DL), nutritionist employment is projected to grow about as fast as the average for all occupations, although growth may be curbed by limitations on insurance reimbursement for dietetic services.

Another concern is the high-powered marketing of Lap-Band surgery virtually as a cosmetic procedure. The best example is the 1-800-GET-THIN freeway billboard campaign here in Southern California, sponsored by a firm that has identified itself as "a marketing company" that "provides marketing for the 'Lap Band®' procedure."

Not that you could ever fall. Riders are harnessed and tethered much like zip-liners. But it's more comfortable, with the straps not riding up as much in the seated position. In one shady spot, I stopped pedaling and just dangled for a while. The cycle gently swayed, and it was very quiet without constant noise of the chain. It would have passed as a decent hammock.
If you were lucky enough to see the Houston Grand Opera production that became a modern template for Porgy and Bess - its national tour stops included the Academy of Music in 1976 - you may recall the masterly singing in a production whose staging was solid but far from great. The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess - now its official title under the ownership of the Gershwin estate - is every bit as much Broadway in its elaborate staging and choreography as it is opera.

These are positive steps, but they don't go far enough. For one thing, the deals and the trade association rules are not binding. The companies can back out of them. They are also opaque; the public really has no idea how far these deals go or how common they are.

Moreover, a vaccine against pleasure and relief, however derived, raises worrying ethical and legal issues that deserve more scrutiny than is currently being given in media coverage on the anti-addiction vaccine "breakthrough." Will vaccine therapy be implemented through legal coercion, as much of rehab is today? Will addicts take dangerously high levels of drugs in an attempt to surpass the vaccine's effect and achieve a high? (This has been observed in anti-cocaine vaccine trials, in both mice and humans.) Will children of drug users be vaccinated?
He demonstrated his stellar skills at the NFL combine, giving teams a better look at what they can expect to see for years to come. Despite his large frame, Kalil ran the 40-yard dash in 4.99 seconds, which ranked second among offensive linemen. His speed and agility allow him to shift up and down the line quickly and pick up defenders in both the running and passing games. Kalil has a quick first step off the snap, allowing him to get into position immediately to either pick up the blitz or control his man on a run. That quickness combined with his size makes him difficult to beat and even more difficult to get away from once he's in control.

I was born in Tokyo in 1971, to my Japanese mother and American father. We relocated from Japan to the United States in 1978, settling eventually near Cleveland. From 1983 until 1990, my father worked at the Perry nuclear power plant, as an employee of the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. As that lyrical name suggests, it was the cheerful height of the nuclear age. In seventh grade, at Madison Middle School, I wrote my paper about the advantages of nuclear power. "It's safe, clean and efficient," I wrote down. We lived seven miles from the plant and on a clear day, we could see the steam plumes billowing white and soft above the cooling towers from our suburban block.

completely jaded, wait for the big one, though perhaps not actively. Indeed humans have a unique ability to ignore the tragic realities and statistics predicting the disasters that may come.

They like to talk, but not about themselves. Vera Katz can go on for hours about school funding or campaign finance reform, as anyone who served with her on the City Council in the 1990s or in the state Legislature knows all too well. Mel Katz is not shy about expressing his opinion on art and culture and the petty rules and regulations that stifle the human spirit. What they don't like -- what Vera Katz particularly doesn't like -- is to talk about a difficult childhood that included an escape out of Nazi-occupied France during World War II or a struggle with a rare form of cancer that almost killed in her last year as mayor. A story of wartime courage and triumph, and a story about a medical miracle, that another politician might repeat endlessly is unknown to almost everyone who knows her name.

This car might be your worst nightmare. A plug-in hybrid electric luxury sedan that costs more than $100,000, from a California company—Orange County, but still—which has borrowed $169 million from taxpayers as part of the Department of Energy's advanced-vehicle-technology loan program; a car built not in the heartland but the socialist paradise of Finland; a car that, with the arithmetic all in, averages 52 mpg-e (that's the EPA's metric for plug-in hybrid EVs), which means that for all its fancy-dancy lithium-iron-phosphate star drive, it gets about the same fuel economy as a conventional Prius hybrid.

Whenever I get the chance to show love to a Diplomats member — whether it's a lowly alum like Un Kasa or the king of kings himself, Cam'ron — I'm going to do it. This is because the Diplomats (better known as Dipset) will go down as one of the best rap cliques of all time, a distinction that, at least for me, requires no second-guessing. It was the Dips' timeless hits, outsized personalities and the insane Harlem flair they brought to everything they did that made them rap's hottest crew for a few years. Before rappers were yelling "Swag!" every 15 seconds, the Diplomats did it without the tiresome reminding. It was just always there.

"He's a big help, and he's somebody you can learn from just by watching him," Smith said. "And we're always on each other about dropping the ball. If you mess up, 'Toom' is the first guy to be all over you. It's pretty funny, but he's just trying to make you better."

There is nothing new or unique about what Gregg Williams said. Although the NFL has now punished Williams and the Saints, for almost its entire history, the NFL glorified violent hits, said the complaint. It encouraged its players to think of themselves as gladiators.

"Bully" has been in the news a lot lately because it received a restrictive R rating (for a small amount of bad language) and then chose to go into theaters unrated. Its distributor, Weinstein Co., made that choice because the film's subject matter, the pervasiveness of school-related bullying and what can be done about it, would seem to cry out for a high school age and younger audience. And "Bully" has an emotional impact that must be viewed to be understood.

Funny thing is she doesn't recall why saving a few bucks seemed worth it at the time. "With other things, I'm a stickler for the truth and being honest. I guess it's a matter of degree, and whether the lie will have serious consequences or not."
"The Kid With a Bike" is another empathetic film by Jean- Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the brothers from Belgium who have strong sympathy for alienated children and young people, and who avoid melodrama and sensation in telling their stories so movingly. There are two things that could go seriously wrong in young Cyril's life, but they don't quite happen. The Dardennes don't wring us out like that. They prefer the drama of ordinary life, in which for a boy like Cyril things don't easily go right. In straightforward, realistic scenes, they show a boy who fears he has been thrown away, but persists in feeling that his father only lost him and will be happy to find him again.

Unfortunately, this may all change if we don't take action. The administration's proposed budget for the 2013 fiscal year -- now in front of Congress -- includes a devastating 20 percent cut to planetary funding. A cut of that scale will eliminate several Mars missions, break international agreements that jointly support other missions, eliminate any large-scale "flagship" missions for the foreseeable future and force us to abandon any plans to explore the potential habitability of the "water moons" Europa and Enceladus, circling Jupiter and Saturn.

Top Picks Analysis: A.J. Smith normally isn't gun-shy about moving up in the first round and snaring a player he covets, but the embattled general manager benefited from holding his ground this year. In desperate need of a dangerous pass rusher to give the defense more bite, the Chargers had the good fortune of having one of this year's best in Ingram fall to them at the 18th overall choice. The squatty college lineman can quickly get to the edge with an explosive first step, plus he's stout enough to hold up against the run and displayed excellent lateral agility at the combine that will aid him in coverage. Another possible starter at a thin position was plucked with the second-round selection of Reyes, a powerful and hard-working prospect with the frame to work as a five-technique end in San Diego's 3-4 alignment. Smith's only trade of the draft came in the third round, when he vaulted five spots to claim Taylor, one of the steadying forces on a dominant LSU defense. He's a good tackler with some range and adequate speed, but his best asset may be in the leadership category.

Kasich's budget proposal chops 25 percent from the fund in 2012 followed by 50 percent in 2013 when compared with 2011 funding levels. His budget also reduces or eliminates tax reimbursements the state makes to cities to cover lost revenue brought on by previous changes to the tax code. These reimbursements were set to expire in the coming years and Kasich's plan accelerates the timetable for larger cities such as Cleveland.

The experience: After the ice melted, my hostess dedicated all her attention to me, encouraging me to relax outside in the cheerful garden beneath the trees and a Tang-colored umbrella at a wood bistro table. She sat with me, explaining the vineyards that flourish just steps away - some scraggly, some meticulous in various stages of pruning - and the agricultural character of the property. It was clear she enjoyed her work, describing each wine as poetry in between slipping away long enough here-and-there to let me savor privately.

Romney: Opposes legal recognition of same-sex marriage and says it should be banned with a constitutional amendment, not left to states. "Marriage is not an activity that goes on within the walls of a state." Also opposes civil unions "if they are identical to marriage other than by name," but says states should be left to decide what rights and benefits should be allowed under those unions. Says certain domestic partnership benefits _largely unspecified — as well as hospital visitation rights are appropriate but "others are not." Says he would not seek to restore the ban on openly gay military members. Asserted in 2002 campaign for Massachusetts governor that "all citizens deserve equal rights, regardless of sexual preference," in tune with statements years earlier as a Senate candidate that equality for gays and lesbians should be a "mainstream concern." But did not explicitly support marriage recognition and, as governor, opposed same-sex marriage when courts legalized it in Massachusetts.

McMillan cautioned that it's early and the Blazers have not settled on an identity yet. He planned on running more in previous seasons and it didn't pan out. And because the team's best player, Aldridge, is scheduled to miss at least the first week of camp recovering from a medical procedure on his heart, it's far too soon to predict what the Blazers' style will look like come midseason.
Of all the people who have been associated associated with the Trail Blazers in their 41 years of existence, the most enduring is surely Bill Schonely, who for almost 30 years was the team's radio play-by-play announcer.

If patients understand that their doctors are practicing high-quality medicine when they employ just the right care for a health problem -- not less but also not more -- we are on the way to solving the problem.

But Gerry and I love the boat and our 9-year-old son Gerald can't get enough of it. So instead of letting the boat sit idle this summer, we decided to look for ways to save on fuel costs whenever possible.

It was hard work, but it rarely felt like it because I loved it so. Similarly, I would urge Gerald to enroll in college classes that mirrored his favorite high-school subjects and passions.

As for the oils, just a little bit goes a long way. And at $25 for a 375-milliliter bottle  available at Kendall Jackson winery in Sonoma County or through WholeVine's website  that's probably a good thing. They're too intense to be used solely for sautéing but can be used in conjunction with other oils. WholeVine's grapeseed oils can also work well when drizzled over soups or as a dipper for breads.

Babies have very compressible chests when they're little, as well as tiny little heads and tiny noses and tiny mouths. If these get covered, it's very dangerous.

Barry Bonds always will be a Hall of Fame candidate. He surely is one of the 10 best players of his generation and probably several others. But will he be a Hall of Famer? That is a question I don't have to worry about answering for another three years or so, until he would become eligible. The biggest question of all, though, may be how would the Hall of Famers receive Bonds if he were elected?. My guess is not very well. American is a forgiving nation but Bonds, and for that matter, Roger Clemens, have shown very little if any contrition for their actions or suspected actions. That creates the sense that they feel they are bigger than the game. And they're not.

Shehadeh's memoir describes six sarhat, walks on which a person "wanders aimlessly, not restricted by time and place, going where his spirit takes him to nourish his soul and rejuvenate himself." In describing walks taken through the countryside around Ramallah between 1978 and 2006, Shehadeh documents "a vanishing landscape" altered by conflict. The San Francisco Chronicle was moved by Shehadeh's method of "lyrically interweaving" his "personal search for connection with the soil with a sobering chronicle of Israeli West Bank settlement."

Does the difference reveal itself in the wines? It sure does.

Desserts were merely fair  and pricey. Our chocolate bombe was a thick and rich cake, but the ho-hum flavor didn't warrant the $9 price.

Cotsonika, Yahoo! Sports: "The Sharks were the only team that made the conference final in each of the past two years. They improved on paper in the off-season, and even though they didn't show it on the ice, they got their act together down the stretch when in danger of missing the playoffs. Like the Capitals, they have not succeeded as favorites and can now relish the role of the underdog. Their top players have far more playoff experience than the Blues."

I know Barner appeared to indicate he was staying, but I don't think we will know for sure until the declaration deadline is behind us. Running backs take a beating. If Barner's NFL evaluation comes back high enough, he might decide he wants to earn a paycheck for the pummeling. Who could blame him?

Reaching out to the man who tried to smear him was one of Tressel's best moments. But it wasn't as if Ohio State was blameless. No one seemed to want to know much about what Clarett was doing. Tressel also experienced a dress rehearsal for the Clarett scandal with Ray Isaac, the quarterback of his first national championship team at Youngstown State, yet he did not closely monitor the troubled Clarett to prevent a recurrence.
Getting on one's Lycra and wearing it out in public is becoming a holiday tradition for some, however, as the Santa Speedo Run in Portland just celebrated its third year. I was a witness. There were plenty of Santa hats, suspenders and spandex skivvies to gawk at. Fundraising for the Ethiopia Project, the Santa Speedo 5K down Northwest 23rd Avenue, raised about $1,600 for the Portland nonprofit this month. With just 50 or so runners, that amount would not have been possible without a slew of unpaid volunteers and a large donation of beer from Deschutes Brewery. The Ethiopia Project gathers shoes to create recreational opportunities in Ethiopia. It also is working to help villages get clean water and build new schools. (Learn more about the Ethiopia Project online at Ethiopiaproject.com. The group needs money and volunteers -- and shoes.)

A one-way ride costs a quarter, or five rides for a buck. No tourist, however, has ever felt the need to take more than one ride. Angelenos, without any proper cable cars to compare it to, always make a big fuss about the fate of their beloved Angels Flight, which spent three decades in a warehouse while Bunker Hill was being remodeled and another nine years in the fix-it shop after the accident.

The Clarks gave Mulfinger and Kemp carte blanche on the design, but there were some things that were not negotiable: They wanted plenty of room for their three kids and their friends, a studio space for Tara and a design that steers clear of superfluous sentimentality. At the same time, they wanted the house to nurture their connection to the rugged landscape right outside their window.

A: I still people think people don't drink enough rosé - they still have the White Zin relationship in their head. There are three reasons, really, that people don't drink it: One, they are afraid they won't know what to order; two, there are a lot of really bad ones out there because any winery makes a rosé now. It's often fruity and almost sweet, lacking acidity and character. There's no love that goes with it.

Who cares, that is beyond those who own him, train him and ride him and, most of all, bet him. In the week leading up to this race, I told my racing colleague Ed Fountaine that the worst nightmare a writer could have in this race would have a horse like Drossselmeyer win it all, to beat a fine colt like Uncle Mo, a brilliant filly like Havre de Grace, an international superstar like So You Think.

It may be a prejudice, but people are continually surprised to find this caliber of restaurant in the Westin Hotel on Third Street just off Market. I can't tell you how many times people have written me to let me know they were skeptical but became converts after tasting Richard Corbo's take on rustic Venetian-inspired food. His specialties include a stellar sformato, a dense souffle made with lobster and ground polenta when I visited; perfectly done arancini (risotto balls); and halibut cheeks with polenta and jalapeno-mint marinara. With a sexy interior and one of the best outdoor spaces in the city, it's a great addition to the dining scene.

However, just when "Jitney" threatens to be nothing but a gabfest, a galvanizing conflict rears its considerable head. There have been hundreds of plays that deal with conflicts between fathers and sons, but few have shown the one here. Booster has just been released from prison after 20 years.

“It’s not that winning the game would have made it easy, because it wouldn’t have, but for a minute or two after it was over, that entire scenario of the advantage of playing fewer games overall did cross my mind,” Mike Rupp told The Post following yesterday’s optional skate at the Garden.
After ATA lost Johnson County, the Metro's average daily ridership cratered. It dropped from 92,700 in 1981 to 61,600 a decade later. In recent years, it has been bumping along between 50,000 and 54,000, with a spike to 56,300 in 2008, when gasoline prices breached $4 a gallon. Average daily ridership, however, counts trips, not people. One person transferring makes two trips. The actual number of people on bus seats each day: about 30,000.

He's right. As such, the leading candidates are issuing tough-talking news releases. Their aides are portraying the opposition as unelectable or dishonest. Charges and countercharges are flying. YouTube videos that mock the candidates are popping up. And, of course, hard-hitting mailings are landing in the mailboxes of Republicans in the 5th District, which stretches from segments of Broad Ripple all the way north to Marion. The district also includes Hamilton County and Zionsville.

A: Tart. Believe it or not, they do get "sweeter" the longer they stay on the vine. You'll notice dried cranberries are sweeter still, and that's because they're marinated with some form of sugar or fruit juice.

"NOAA early warning systems provide critical information to residents and emergency managers so that evacuations and emergency preparations can begin promptly," the senators' letter said. "Last March, these early warnings provided first responders with adequate time to reinforce sea walls, sandbag low-lying areas and take other precautionary measures -- these measures were effective at minimizing the loss of life and property during this catastrophic event. A similar system in Japan provided residents with a few moments notice before the inundation and is credited with saving thousands of lives."

Marriage is a sacred commitment and is already in the dumper in this country which mocks God with divorce rates of 60 to 70 percent — even in so-called Christian households. How much do you think it will be respected if you allow those who are unable to understand cleaving together as a sacred rite rather than an immoral act of fornication? If the bill before the Maryland General Assembly is passed then there will be no way that a man should not be able to marry his best friend Fido, or his mother-in-law or even a pedophile to marry a young boy or girl.

As the goalkeepers wandered out for warm-ups, the crowd erupted and I witnessed the phenomenon that is Hope Solo. She’s an extremely talented goalkeeper and athlete, and her smile was contagious as she high fived some waiting fans as she ran out to complete pre-game drills. The crowd yelled messages of encouragement. Ok, they yelled a lot, and the screams varied from actual words to just extremely high pitched wails. Solo did her best to keep on task, waiving to the crowd at points while going through her pre-match drills. The noise got more deafening as the full teams moved out for pre-match drills. I heard plenty of yells of “We love you” with the player’s name at the end to just about everyone, while the signs of support were now scattered throughout the park. As the crowd started to fill in, the noise became more apparent but instead of the usual crescendo of chants for the Timbers, the atmosphere felt more appropriate for a popular band.
Yet director and editor P. David Ebersol seems uncertain throughout of what tale he is telling, whether to focus on Schemel specifically or the larger picture of the band and the moments in contemporary rock history they were all witness to. Often the film pushes Schemel to the edge of what is intended to be her story, so in "Hit So Hard" she feels forced into the role of self-sacrificing side-player once again.

The week in review
Holding on to all of these rustic, but much-beloved, camps does not seem the best use of the Girl Scouts' resources, especially if the camps don't appeal to a majority of the membership. Many scouts -- and, more important, their mothers, who often serve as camp volunteers and chauffeurs -- want camping to be more like home: indoor toilets, electricity and showers, according to the organization's survey. And because so few scouts go camping, the organization has had to spend over $1 million annually to subsidize the seven camps.

"I think it's economic shock," she says. "Marriage is an achievement that you enter into when you're ready. But in the meantime, life happens. You form relationships. You have sex. You get pregnant.

LetsRun.com posted the Indiana release about the Pepsi, which touts the Hoosiers' victory in the men's competition. It doesn't mention either Hostetler's throw or the UO athletes who sat out. Of course, it is a release by Indiana sports information office and, as such, is focused on the Hoosiers.

This long-running Los Angeles duo specializes in frenetic club singles that hit the dance floor with the intensity and urgency of rock. Well, it used to, anyway; recent Crystal Method releases have shaken free from the “big beat” template of the late ’90s and explored deeper and more singular territory. “Divided by Night,” the Grammy-nominated 2009 Crystal Method album, featured collaborations with Hasidic rapper Matisyahu, new-wave revivalist Emily Haines and the pop class clowns in LMFAO, among others. However purists feel about the act’s new direction, few who have caught the Crystal Method in performance would dispute that it is among the most reliably entertaining live acts in electronic music.

Your kids see this. They probably watch these shows with you. I wonder how much of this behavior you do yourself on a daily basis. Do you gloat when you've gotten the best of someone in an argument over a parking space? If you've told someone off, are you gleeful? If so, then you are exhibiting bullying behavior. Think about it. You could end bullying by behaving like an adult and expressing disapproval of bullying behavior — and stop watching those damn reality shows!
Obama has said he will begin drawing down U.S. troops in July 2011. Petraeus has agreed to the drawdown in principle but says his strategy needs time if it is going to succeed.

In his native Czechoslovakia, founder Francis Korbel was blamed for firing one of the shots that started the 1848 revolution against the Hapsburg monarchy, and authorities locked him up in Daliborka prison for four years. Supposedly, he just walked out one day when no one was looking and headed to the United States to make his fortune. At his California winery in the 1880s, he built a tower that looked just like the one in the view from his Prague prison cell.

The silence is stunning."

The beauty of James' folly is he's running in his native Texas. Sure, he starred there at SMU, but that outlaw era earned the program the NCAA's only death penalty. More than two decades later, James' ESPN-enabled crusade helped take down Texas Tech coach Mike Leach. Many sins are forgivable in Texas. Toppling two nationally ranked football programs isn't one of them.

In the short term, Mango faces a formidable challenge, top-seeded Matt McDonough of Iowa in the opening session this morning. His long-range goal might prove an even taller order, though. Mango plans to compete in the Olympic Trials and become part of a brother act. His brother, Spenser, a CBC grad, fought in the 121-pound Greco-Roman class in 2008 in Beijing and plans to compete at the same weight at the Trials. Ryan hopes to qualify at 132 pounds; he has finished as high as third in national-level Greco-Roman competitions.

The system could get even bigger in the next few years. University of Maryland has entered into an agreement to invest in Dimensions Healthcare System, which owns the troubled Prince George's Hospital Center in Cheverly, and likely add it to its network.

The financially troubled St. Joseph put itself up for sale last year after one of its cardiologists was accused of putting unnecessary stents in heart patients.

More likely, the city would "re-enter" the county as its 92nd municipality. The city of St. Louis would keep its own mayor and aldermen and fire department. But it likely would shed many of the functions that St. Louis County also performs, such as collecting property taxes and running a prosecutor's office and its own courts. It would, governmentally speaking, become a giant urban Kirkwood.

Like the service, the room can be a touch abrasive. The cinderblock wall filled with a ton of empty picture frames (apparently some kind of evocation of an Italian family basement or a dive bar) is like the design-equivalent of a comedian bombing on stage. Though it must be said, the bar side of the restaurant featuring a nice expanse of what looks like cheap-blonde wainscoting also boasts a fancy new penny-colored, copper-top bar.

But ships move through canals in both directions, and so the impact of a new set of locks in Panama cannot be measured solely in terms of lost cargo. Just as the expanded canal will enable more all-water trade between Shanghai and Savannah, Ga., California ports could expect to benefit from an increase in the volume of goods arriving by sea from Europe, Africa and South America. In one local example, the Port of West Sacramento's new harbor crane, which arrived earlier this month, transited the Panama Canal en route from its European manufacturer.
Look at the AFC West. Denver, which needs people around Peyton Manning, traded its first-round pick to New England and then traded out of the first round entirely. Kansas City took defensive lineman Dontari Poe, who's still learning how to play. Oakland had no first-round pick.

At one point, Pritchard was Allen's Golden Boy, and in the early years of Pritchard's era, the two sent waves of text messages to each other, and talked excitedly during games from Allen's courtside seats. But near the end of Pritchard's three-year run, Allen viewed Pritchard as too visible, too audible and too mischievous. Allen sent a messenger to Pritchard months before he was fired, saying he was no longer welcomed to sit next to him at Rose Garden games.

As New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees continues to close in on Dan Marino's single-season passing record, he is carrying his entire team along with him. Brees threw for 412 yards and five touchdowns Sunday in a 42-20 win over Minnesota, leading the Saints to their sixth win in a row. New Orleans had to overcome a sloppy start against Minnesota, including turning the ball over twice deep in its own territory in the first half, botching a surprise onside kick and having a 40-yard TD pass called back because of a penalty. But it mattered little to Brees and the red-hot Saints. Brees now has 4,780 passing yards this season, putting him 304 away from Marino's single-season record of 5,084 yards that he set in 1984. With two games to play, that leaves Brees needing to average just over 150 yards per game. It's hard to imagine Marino's record won't fall.

That’s when Jordyn Peck, a sophomore, started Shaker Heights’ run. He scored two field goals and had an assist on another. That seemed to energize the Raiders, who started to run and force the issue.

Top Picks Analysis: A.J. Smith normally isn't gun-shy about moving up in the first round and snaring a player he covets, but the embattled general manager benefited from holding his ground this year. In desperate need of a dangerous pass rusher to give the defense more bite, the Chargers had the good fortune of having one of this year's best in Ingram fall to them at the 18th overall choice. The squatty college lineman can quickly get to the edge with an explosive first step, plus he's stout enough to hold up against the run and displayed excellent lateral agility at the combine that will aid him in coverage. Another possible starter at a thin position was plucked with the second-round selection of Reyes, a powerful and hard-working prospect with the frame to work as a five-technique end in San Diego's 3-4 alignment. Smith's only trade of the draft came in the third round, when he vaulted five spots to claim Taylor, one of the steadying forces on a dominant LSU defense. He's a good tackler with some range and adequate speed, but his best asset may be in the leadership category.

​The former Seabra’s — one of Newark’s perennially popular restaurants — is now known as Rio Rodizio, and the name is a clue to the main attraction: the nonstop orgy of grilled meats known as rodizio.

I’ll say this: If you don’t add rodizio to your NCAA tournament eating resume — whether here or at one of the Ironbound restaurants — you’ll be all the poorer.

Like glasses or orthodontics, "whatever it is, you fix it," Tammy says. Even if it is more complicated than eye charts, or braces, which Max has needed, twice. She is nervous about Max's surgery, because there are risks with any surgery. But she knows that if he should ever change his mind -- though she doesn't think he will -- it is reversible. And the only other path -- forcing Max to continue being a brutally unhappy Makenzie -- wasn't an option at all.

On "Curiouser," the pair shot the works, decorating every track with synths and six-string overdubs, and all the funny voices Miller-Heidke could coax out of her throat. The album scared off listeners allergic to elaborate arrangements, which might have been part of the pair's sinister plan for smart-aleck world domination.

Pippa Middleton media frenzy: When Prince William and Kate Middleton got hitched, the lovely sister of the bride (who rocked her curve-skimming maid of honor dress) got the attention she deserved.

But I know if I just stay true to the experience, and to what I see as real, it's not gonna leave 'em in a dark place -- it just exposes a dark place. I guess what I'm saying is that it's OK to talk about it. I also think if I explain how hard is has been for me, people don't feel so alone. I know that's my reaction when I listen to sad, hard songs -- 'Oh God, they went through that, too. I'm not so alone.'"

Dear Margo: I recently was baptized and joined the Mormon Church. I really enjoy my new "family" except for one person: the bishop. This feeling is taboo because people act like he walks on water. I say he is just a man appointed to a position. This man didn't like me the minute he met me. When I started at this church, I was in crisis, and I told a couple of people about it. They said go to the bishop. He turned me down flat-out and said, "We don't help people financially." That was a bald-faced lie, and I knew it. The excuses I got were that I was not a member yet, that he was stressed, blah, blah, blah. As time progressed, my problem became worse. Again, I was turned down, and he didn't even call me by the right name. I corrected him twice about my name, and he still got it wrong, which was proof to me that he was doing it on purpose. Do you think I am making something out of nothing? And to whom do I go to let someone know about this person? I think he treats me badly because I am disabled. (I think this because there are other disabled people who also dislike him.) — Disillusioned

The DVD was made without his cooperation, so it’s mostly left to music journalists and Eno’s former collaborators to explain what he was all about. But it’s still a documentary that fills a big hole. Many of rock’s great stories have been told so many times they’ve lost their charm, but Eno in the ’70s has been severely underdocumented until now.
"I thought he was pressing early, looking for his offense and trying to make things happen. Now he's allowing his offense to come to him. That could be more minutes ... when he came off the bench he was trying to cram 30 minutes into 15-20. Now he's allowing the game to come to him offensively and he's getting to spots and making plays. We're not running a lot of plays for him; he's just playing off of guys. With more minutes he's been able to be more productive. I think he's back focused on what he does, which is defend and let the offense come to him."
Frustrated again in the third round of the Masters, Woods chunked his driver and took a big divot out of the 13th tee box after ripping one into the trees on the par-five hole.

They decided to seek professional help. They went to St. Luke's Hospital to meet with the "Sleep Lady," Nancy Birkenmeier, a legend among sleepless parents. She creates a detailed plan for families to help their child sleep better. Her plans seem like a kinder, more compassionate approach to the strict Ferber method, which advocates teaching babies to self-soothe by crying for a set amount of time before being comforted by parents. For some, letting a baby cry unattended is too difficult to bear.

Overall, Hulu is a big improvement over rivals such as Joost, which requires you to download a player that plants itself on your desktop and keeps jabbing you in the ribs with annoying pop-ups and invitations to share content with your friends. When I was settling down to watch an episode of the old ABC drama "Twin Peaks" and tried to remove a Joost pop-up for a credit-card company, I instead got kicked immediately into a commercial for the same advertiser. Not fun.

The Condos live just down the river from Yasuni National Park's riverbank clay licks. That's where thousands of parrots congregate daily to eat mineral-laden clay.

Many vegan dishes, however, are already beloved; we eat fruit salad, peanut butter and jelly, beans and rice, eggplant in marinara sauce. The problem faced by many of us - brought up as we were with plates whose center was filled with a piece of an animal - is in imagining less-traditional vegan dishes that are creative, filling, interesting and not especially challenging to either put together or enjoy.

It's a powerful position, and then it's not a powerful position," says Louis-Dreyfus, 51. "Inherent in that is great comedy.

Everyone interviewed for this story said they sought disability payments reluctantly and would prefer to work.
For the Mars crowd, that means real people in real relationships, real raunchy, real funny. Thank you, Kristen Wiig for every single one of those old-school Rs. In fact, so unusual is this sort of humor in testosterone-driven ha-ha-Hollywood these days, it almost makes me ha-ha-happy that producer Judd Apatow is currently the industry-anointed 800-pound clown prince, since it probably took all 800 pounds of his princely powers to get this film made. (R-rated female-centric, gal-pal entertainments don't exactly top studio wish lists.)
"A blowout these days is an affordable luxury similar to a manicure or pedicure," says Melanie Groom of Blo, a Toronto-based chain with a San Francisco location and plans for expansion in the Bay Area. "We feel really, really good when our hair is done. There's a certain way you walk. That's the No. 1 thing we try to have them leave with ... more confidence."
While effusive in her praise for Kansas City-area officials for "focusing on what's best for kids," Cunningham blasted St. Louis County superintendents, accusing them of foot-dragging since the Turner decision was handed down.

TOMS RIVER — Minutes after finishing his shift on a special holiday anti-drunken driving detail, an Ocean Gate police officer was killed early today after a drunken driver crashed into his vehicle on the Garden State Parkway, authorities said.
It's a telling image, at once fanciful and suggestive. That lightness of being which Max experiences on a personal level was felt more widely, for example, by thousands of immigrants whose records were destroyed by the quake and fire. Overnight, by default, they attained the buoyancy of citizenship. That's a pivotal point in Maxine Hong Kingston's 1980 book "China Men."
When the InterContinental Hotel brand took over the 18th-century mansion Porto Palacio das Cardosas, preserving the landmark's baroque façade, it punctuated the city center's rise. With a flourish. The sprawling cleaned-up villa is now all swish grandeur, outdoing even Lisbon's poshest hangouts. The complex encompasses a wellness center, formal greenhouse restaurant, cafe Astoria (the better culinary choice), and suitably neo-baroque guestrooms, each a swirl of damask, silver-leafed desks, padded leather headboards, marble bathrooms and jewel-toned wing chairs.
Mahendra Dubey, a lawyer for Dr. Sen, said the court observed that no case of sedition had been made out against Dr. Sen. The court's rationale could not immediately be confirmed but it could represent a significant legal victory for Dr. Sen in a case that has attracted global attention.

Adams, who ran the award show gauntlet earlier this year for her role in "The Fighter," found it more difficult to switch between flashy gowns at night and Mary's conservative ensembles by day during production than working with puppets. She said acting opposite puppets like Walter wasn't any more difficult than working opposite actors like Mark Wahlberg.

"People Meters changed things, but February, May and November still seem to be most important," said Shawn Bartelt, general manager of ABC affiliate WFTV-Channel 9. "It's because for all of the networks, almost every episode is fresh. You're not in reruns. Just about all of your syndicated programming is fresh: 'Dr. Oz,' 'Judge Judy.' If you're looking for apples to apples what's going on, you get that picture better in November, February and May."

8:28: And we're at the club with Chris Breezy. He's now walking atop a structure that looks like green jello. Oh so this is that song that had its video playing in every bar with a TV this year. Actually, this was a pretty performance, with all the dreamy colors. No skateboarders in sight.
A LOW WAGE SUPPORT PROGRAM
Van Gundy will be fired between now and the end of the season. There's no way he survives this dysfunctional episode. He probably was done in Orlando anyway despite his popularity with some Magic players and four straight playoff appearances that include a trip to the 2009 NBA Finals. Ownership and management almost always side with the star when he becomes at odds with the coach. When Howard agreed to stay for one more season, you had tofigure it was at the cost of Van Gundy's job.

You need to carefully trace each runner back to its source. Then you have two choices: Dig the roots out, or cut the vine off and paint the stump with undiluted Eraser, Weed-Master, Credit 41 or other 41 percent glyphosate herbicide or a 50 percent solution of Roundup.
But they are concerned the withdrawals would be averaged out over three months. That could allow a business to exceed the thresholds without applying for a permit. For example, a withdrawal from Lake Erie of 6 million gallons in a single day would not trigger the permitting process when averaged out over 90 days. Supporters of the new plan counter that such doomsday scenarios are impractical.

Electrodes in the right place (determined partly by trial and error) seem to interact with various nerve networks, Meloy says, including nerves from the pelvis that enter the spinal highway near the tailbone. Stimulating those nerves shoots pleasure signals straight up to the part of the brain that processes information coming from the genitalia.

Under the plan, each municipality that joins the county force would dissolve its department. Because of federal labor law, only 49 percent of the officers in each town could be rehired to join the county force. Who would hire the balance of the officers, however, remain undecided.
With time came additional hates. The "do as you're told" response to my protests. The chores requiring completion before a backyard adventure could be launched. The daily wearing of black and white saddle shoes when other girls wore Keds.
Perry's stumble was hard to watch, an awkward 54 seconds that he has since noted felt like hours.
Researchers also found that 51 percent of San Diego's restaurants are fast food eateries, compared with 25 percent nationwide and 49 percent statewide. Studies have shown a link between easy access to fast food and a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes. The study also found that 4 percent of San Diegans have limited access to healthy food, defined as living less than a mile from a grocery store in metropolitan counties and less than 10 miles in non-metropolitan counties.

As a recent U-T editorial noted, all around the world, elected officials are backing away from AB 32-style "cap-and-trade" rules forcing the use of cleaner but costlier energy because they fear the rules would prolong the global economic downturn.

Dee suggested to Queen Elizabeth a cycle of eight leap years every 33 years. The leap years would come every fourth year starting with the fourth of the cycle, putting a five-year gap between the last leap year of the cycle and the first of the next cycle. Dee didn't invent the system, says Duncan Steel, an astronomer at the Australian Centre for Astrobiology and author of a book about calendar history. A variant of the system remains in use in Iran today, a millennium after Persians first used one like it.
Whether the Democrats and Republicans like it or not, they are in bed together and may as well be married. Neither has a majority in both houses of Congress that can impose one-party rule. The filibuster provision in the Senate allows a minority to stymie the majority. The Constitution doesn't guarantee that political bedfellows will get along - there were no parties when the Constitution was written, and now we observe a marriage from hell. Unlike civil marriage, there's no chance for a divorce.
Your worry starts with dormancy fees, charges placed against the card even if there is no activity. Under the new rules, those charges can’t be applied to a card until it has been dormant for at least a year, and can only be applied once every month. Since the rules are not in effect now, however, dormancy fees can be more regular and can start sooner.

Joel Fink, owner of Fantasy Candies in Lyndhurst, launched the evening with a talk about chocolate and its health benefits. In a presentation punctuated with just enough medical lingo to ensure his street cred among the science set, Fink explained the growing body of evidence linking high-cocoa dark chocolate with heart and vascular health, insulin sensitivity, serum cholesterol levels and even advances in Alzheimer's disease research.
She is, not surprisingly, even more uncensored live. "I could never say that on TV," she admitted after one outrageous joke. "Even on Bravo, which is, like, a fake channel."
"Each one's different," Stewart said, adding that he believed if Mizzou had defeated Michigan, "I think we would have been in the Final Four a number of times, because there wasn't anything we did once that we didn't then do multiple times."
Bilderback said sunny summer weekends can bring twice as many people into the district's response area, which normally includes about 7,000 people. The Dal Baker Trust donated the money for the boat to the fire district, Bilderback said, to help firefighters deal with the increase in call volume.

Illinois is one of only seven states that don't charge an admission fee to its recreation areas. But it also has $750 million in overdue repairs and maintenance, thanks to those declining budgets. Lawmakers are considering a bill that would allow the DNR to charge $5 to $8 for a daily pass or up to $25 for an annual sticker. The measure, sponsored by Rep. Jo Ann Osmond, R-Antioch, already has passed the House.
Harper, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 draft, also had his first multi-hit game with two doubles and a single from the No. 7 spot in the lineup. He scored his first career run in the fourth inning, knocking the ball out of the catcher's glove.

ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr., March 9: "There's still some concerns about Newton and if he can deal with adversity of performance. It's come easy to Newton. He's dominated at every level. He's never been around losing. How effective is he moving forward dealing with negativity about performance? Other quarterbacks have had to struggle at times. He's never struggled. This guy, it's been lights-out. When it's not easy, can he adjust and improve? How will he deal with that? Is he going to work hard enough to do that?"
Early experiences taught Keller to treat each ingredient with care and respect. He recalls the time he accidentally snapped the leg of a rabbit when he reached into the cage to grab it and didn't have a proper grip. He still remembers the squeal of pain, but that gruesome incident became a defining moment in shaping his approach to food -- every element is treated with dignity, and cooked in a way that celebrates it. Keller is one of the most thoughtful and precise of chefs, and it shows in every preparation. He's so exacting and particular that he has designed just about every plate and serving piece in the restaurant. About a year ago, he raised his menu price from $115 to $175, and recently also added an automatic gratuity, which is split among the staff -- much as Chez Panisse has been doing for years. While the price is formidable, with Keller's culinary genius and Laura Cunningham's front-of-the-house magic, the experience is well worth the extra dollars. The menu changes anywhere from 30 to 60 percent a night, depending on what's fresh that day.

It was nicely done, because the top eight finishers score. At the close of the first day, the Arizona women led with 71 points. Oregon was second with 65, but the Ducks should run away with the competition when the meet concludes today.
The family's constant use of hand sanitizers and avoiding direct contact with doorknobs and grocery carts wasn't enough to avoid the flu, they say.

My family disowned me, put me through emotional hell that caused the man I loved to pull away, to cut off all contact with me, to tell me to call him when I was "single."
With a progressive tax system -- supposedly requiring the rich to pay more of their income than the poor -- it's indefensible that some wealthy people enjoy preferential treatment. It subverts any sense of fairness. And raising the top rate wouldn't much hurt the economy if the rate isn't punitive. To me, 30 percent seems reasonable. It's lower than today's top rate, 35 percent; and it roughly equals the top rate on capital gains (mainly profits from stock sales) in the late 1980s. That was 28 percent; the economy did fine.

Steamed clams ($13), along with some great fries, could also be enough to satisfy a hearty appetite.

“Dale & Tucker vs. Evil” is, as its title suggests, not a movie that takes itself seriously, as “Red State” and the recent “Straw Dogs” remake do. But in some ways it may be the most serious movie of all.

Hell served as an apt metaphor for the show -- as in putting patrons through an hour of it. The humor was forced, the music unfamiliar, the singing flat and the sketches forgettable. There was even a recurring passing gas gag. (I kid you not.)
That is, carrying a concealed weapon -- whether by nuns, rabbis, classroom teachers, Little League coaches or that mouthy in-law who gets on your last nerve -- would be the "default" mode: You would assume that everyone whose path crossed yours each day packed heat in a pocket or purse.

DG: Whiting received some consideration for the club's Pitcher of the Year Award within in the Cardinals' front office. He started the year in the bullpen but emerged to be the most consistent starter for Low-A Quad Cities. Was the best prospect in that rotation? No, Carlos Martinez was to start the year and Trevor Rosenthal was to finish it. But you could call Whiting the ace of the group. He is the latest control pitcher to succeed at that level, following P.J. Walters and Trey Hearne, to name two. Folks I've spoken to believe Whiting's stuff is a tick better, and that will have to be true for him to ascend. Boone has command of three pitches, he operates in that 88-91 mph area, and he has what's advertised as a true swing-and-miss slider. That last trait will serve him well as he advances, and it does feed the notion that relief work could be in his future. Right now, he'll stay as a starter because of his mix of pitches and his ability to fit them into the edges of the strike zone. It makes sense for him to be on the same "track" as the pitchers he echoes - a steady climb through the system. Hearne had trouble in Class AA. Walters and his changeup had difficulty in the majors. Like those two, Whiting will have to master the level before moving ahead, and his first test will come in Springfield, when he gets there.

A car wreck is not just one collision; it's three. First, you have the vehicle collision - when your car, truck, SUV, dune buggy or whatever hits something. Then comes the body collision, when your body hits the inside of the vehicle. Then you have the organ collision, when your organs slam against the inside of your body. Not pretty.

True quesadillas are more like cornmeal masa turnovers, or empanadas, most traditionally deep-fried.

In some of the country's most ambitious dog houses, meat has strayed to the unusual — rabbit and duck and heritage pig, topped variously with chutneys and aiolis and other exotica. Jason Fernandez, owner of the 6-month-old Hot Willy's Sausage and Italian Beef Superstore in Ybor City, has kept his vision more on terra firma. That didn't stop the Wall Street Journal from including the newcomer recently in a best-hot dog roundup. Opened at the beginning of the year, the casual stand has a number of things going for it.

When potential voters turn directly to the Internet for information, there is an even more intense search for self-satisfying bias. Fully 33 percent of those who went online to get political news last year sought information from sites that "share my point of view," the Pew study shows. That's up from 26 percent in 2004. The biggest change came among the young, with the share of those 18 to 24 saying they got political news from online sites that reflected their viewpoint jumping to 43 percent in 2008, up from 22 percent in 2004.
It was around that time that Los Gatos locals who had seen him dining with his family in prior years saw him instead partying at the bars. With a restricted driver's license from a 2010 drunken driving arrest, an armed body guard who doubled as a driver escorted him around town. He would often mix water with $200 bottles of Silver Oak cabernet. He was kicked out of at least one bar and at times could get loud and argue with other patrons, said Pete Jillo, a friend and owner of Gardino Fresco on Santa Cruz Avenue. But he had a big heart, Jillo said, ﻿and was a generous philanthropist. He even bought paintings from a local homeless man.

In a flash, the thief lifts the enormous hollow luggage, puts it over the tourist's bag, and calmly wheels away the Trojan Horse with his prized catch inside."

There's no reason to doubt the sincerity of Zimmerman's friends when they say the man is devastated by the tragic events of Feb. 26. And there's every reason to advocate that everyone take a deep breath and condemn the vigilante mentality that has "The New Black Panther Party" idiotically placing a $10,000 bounty for the "capture" of a man who is not a fugitive and Louis Farrakhan saying "soon, very soon, the law of retaliation may . . . be applied."

Anyway, that's who threw a first pitch at Wrigley last week, Johnson, a former Columbia College and School of the Art Institute student who once sent a manifesto to critics that read: "Young artist seeks audience ... Must enjoy race mongering, disparate disconnected thoughts and sunsets ... Ability to hold conversation using only rap lyrics, and a sense of humor, a must." Before the game, Todd Ricketts, one of the Cubs owners, stood alongside the Cubs dugout and with a scrunched-up face said that Heller had shown him Johnson's work. Ricketts flipped through the catalog, he's not a political-art fan, but, sure, the guy is interesting.

This technique spares a large number of healthy tissue while also most completely expunging cancer cells.

Dear Mr. Dad: My mother-in-law has an opinion on every conceivable parenting topic. The problem is that those opinions are usually unwelcome and unhelpful. Besides that, every time she's at my house, she insists on telling me (and my wife when she's there) how we should raise our children. What can I do before I snap?
I thought we couldn't afford matching furniture or Hummel figurines, and that my mom was too tired to create those snow-scenes on the windows. But I grew up to realize that my mother had something better than money; she had taste. She painted and sketched and made clothes so beautiful that after her memorial service, one of my sister's friends wept as she told me about the elegance of the French seams my mother put inside a formal she'd sewn for her as a gift. Today, years after she's gone, my brother, sister and I have my mom's paintings on the walls of our homes.

But after preparing the strata-in-a-skillet devised by the perfectionists at America's Test Kitchen and Cook's Illustrated magazine, I don't think I can go back to my old ways. The texture of the skillet strata is denser than a soufflé but lighter than a traditional strata, with a custardy bread pudding vibe. The flavor is suburb, with pepper Jack cheese offering a little bit of spicy heat, and bacon pitching in with its signature smoky fat-meat luxury.

To further justify changing the law, Maag and supporters argue that Ohio's conceal carry law is not applied uniformly and is more restrictive than the laws in other states. They also argue that permit holders are among the most law-abiding citizens, and therefore, would alert officers as a courtesy. But making it "a duty," they say, abridges their freedom.
The very small particles that we're concerned about in terms of your health are much smaller and typically cannot be seen by the naked eye, but you can see them under a microscope. We talk about them in terms of micrometers in size, or a millionth of a meter. They are typically discussed in the context of what you can breathe or inhale. There are particles of less than 10 microns in size and diameter (PM10), which are inhalable. But those are considered coarse and pretty big particles in terms of what you can breathe in.

Had Mattingly played on better Yankee teams, I think he would be getting more Hall of Fame consideration. I feel this way because Mattingly's career numbers are nearly identical to those of the late Kirby Puckett, who was enshrined in Cooperstown in 2001, which was his first year on the ballot.

Now heres a really cool connection. That delicious, creamy vanilla bean ice cream served with your profiterole at Aixois? Its made by Poppys Ice Cream, once upon a time known as Docs. Teresa Poppinga has been operating since July 2007 out of a little shop on the edge of historic downtown Lees Summit at 307 S.E.

Air samplings along the south edge of the property, which is lined by houses, showed methane concentrations of 30 to 40 percent a couple of years ago, Schwarz said. Methane's explosive range is between 5 and 15 percent concentration; heavier than that and there isn't enough oxygen to sustain a fire, but the higher readings were still troubling. However, the most recent readings were "quite low," below 5 percent, and the methane extraction system is "working quite well," he says.

Then comes the defense, which has played outstanding all season and deserves much credit for those gaudy goalie stats. And not only do they protect the net, they produce. Kevin Shattenkirk's 23 points ranks 18th in the league among defensemen and Alex Pietrangelo comes in right behind him with 21 points, good enough for 26th among defensemen. And with Shatty (plus-17), Petro (+14) and Barret Jackman (+13), the Blues have three defensemen who rank in the top

This is all terrific stuff, vivid and honest, which is what happens when writers enter their discomfort zones. And yet, what strikes me most is how, not unlike the city it describes, such material reveals itself to us in pieces - which are another metaphor. In that regard, it seems oddly fitting that the most comprehensive literary response to the riots remains Anna Deavere Smith's "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992," a theater piece, written and performed by an outsider who channels the cacophony of voices at the city's heart.

The ironic truth is that I suspect there are countless good priests and nuns who favor my point of view but are essentially muzzled by the archdiocese and the Vatican.

The first day of playoff practice always has a little more hop to it, and not just because Zamboni-sensei Al Sobotka holds one of his traditional barbecues. The Wings may be the fifth seed to Nashviile's fourth, and they may be going up against a team that's big and physical, but they feel well-prepared because all their injured guys, save Helm, have been back long enough to feel good about themselves.
One of the reviews, published in the journal of the American College of Nutrition in 2009, found that there may be important differences depending on the type of omega-3 supplement. Fish oil contains two types: DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid). Studies that used pure DHA or more than 50% DHA reported no effect on depression. Studies using pure EPA or more than 50% EPA found that symptoms improved.

It is the unapologetic "older generation" here -­­ Joe's sharply defensive second wife, Vera (MaryAnn Thebus in crackling good form), and his now well-to-do best friend, Morty (Mike Nussbaum, beyond perfection, in what seems like a custom-made role), who easily steal the spotlight here. They explain that what seemed right at a time when it was Soviet soldiers in the forefront of the fight against Hitler and fascism, may look very different now.

Perhaps one reason college baseball is growing is because of its fan friendliness. It hasn't yet fully prostituted itself to TV networks and still caters to the paying customers who attend games. Players are accessible to fans, and fans grow attached to the players. Unlike college basketball, where the best of the best are one-and-done, college baseball players are bound to stay in school for at least three years.
Burned out by his work in the South, Evans took a job as a writer and editor with Time Magazine and, later, Fortune magazine. But it was during this time that he produced one of his great projects -- although it wasn't published until 1966, years after the photos were shot. The so-called "Subway Series" is made up of penetrating portraits of average New Yorkers riding underground, caught by a camera Evans kept hidden under his coat. It is a reflection of something Evans wrote in 1960: "Stare. It's the way to educate your eye. Stare, pry, listen, eavesdrop."

Week 16 is finally here, and after Monday night’s game, the fantasy football season will be over for most of us, if your season hasn’t been ended already. My teams went 1-for-5 on what I will now call Black Sunday, so the best I can do in my leagues is a gold medal and four bronzes. Please make it happen, Matthew Stafford.

A: The foot traffic. There are three places you take people to in this town: the Pearl, Northwest 23rd and Mississippi. Those are the top three. After that it's Hawthorne or Alberta. But Mississippi is one of the big three that you walk around in, with lots of street fairs and people.
If intimacy and dining go hand in hand, it doesn't get more intimate than Yamo in the Mission District, where patrons rub elbows at the tiny, counter-only Burmese restaurant. The food fuses the tastes of India and China in dishes like spiced fried rice and wok-tossed noodles with curry, both specialties at Yamo. The place is family run and owned, and the food is made a la minute. That can mean a wait, as the orders pile up and two cooks hover furiously over the tiny stove, but the owner and customers seem happy to socialize. The chewy, long egg noodles are great with tender curry beef ($5.25) or in the Yamo cold noodles ($5.25), which come topped with hot chicken and loaded with fresh vegetables. To start, don't miss the tea salad ($5.25), which features chopped cabbage, tea leaves and lots of crunchy bits like peanuts and fried lentils. There's a good dose of spice in most of the food, so ask the staff to pop open the top of a fresh young coconut ($2.50) to cool your palate.
Americans have long been entranced by hooligans who laundered money, bootlegged, bullied and killed. Entrepreneurs have bused tourists to mob haunts in Newark, N.J.; Kansas City, Mo.; and Chicago.

The food at Agave Grill is great, but it's the small touches that add flair to the dishes and make the restaurant noteworthy. The chips and salsa are both made on site, as are the tortillas. When the basket of chips arrives at your table don't be surprised if they're still warm and doughy. They were probably just pulled out of the fryer and sprinkled with chipotle seasoning. The salsa is bright and filled with chunky pieces of tomatoes, onions and peppers. Do you like it hot? Just ask for something spicier and you'll be given two choices: roasted serrano or habanero salsa. Be sure to use the chips as a scoop while you devour the shrimp cocktail, which is more like ceviche.

Unlike the more common osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease - the body attacks the lining of a joint as if it were trying to protect it from injury or disease. The lining becomes inflamed and fluid builds up in the joints, resulting in pain, swelling and stiffness that may affect many different joints at the same time. Usually at least two or three different joints are involved on both sides of the body, often in a mirror-image pattern.
During service, Hollingsworth and a sous chef stand at the pass - where busers pick up the food and take it to the dining room - plating food and inspecting. Beyond the main kitchen are two other rooms where the commis - paid apprentices - and stages work on their prep list. They arrive at 5 a.m. and stay until they're done, 10 to 14 hours later. A band of windows wraps around the kitchen, and natural sunlight filters in, glinting off the hanging copper pots. Outside, lush vineyards rolled into the hills, but I was the only one looking.

Overall, it's fair to say the Orthodox Church has flown below the radar in American culture since it first came to North America in the eighteenth century through Russian missionary settlements in Alaska and via droves of immigrants from Eastern Mediterranean and East European countries beginning in the late nineteenth century. Indeed, it is often through ethnic events - whether Greek, Romanian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Russian, or Arab – that people first become acquainted with the Orthodox Church. So it's not unusual that encounters with the Orthodox begin through one's appetite for baklava or pirogy, or perhaps while attending a friend's "Big Fat Greek Wedding".

For Whedon, Cabin in the Woods' third-place start is a victory in that it meant the film escaped the shelf upon which it had been sitting since its original studio, MGM, went bankrupt.

As we climbed, our posture changed like a reverse time lapse of human development. At first, I charged straight ahead like the Homo erectus I am, but as the terrain got steeper, I slouched, closer and closer to the ground, until I was using my hands as much as my feet. Within an hour, the trail disappeared, and we simply tacked back and forth over the debris accumulated through the long life of a volcano.
"Judging by newspaper headlines of the early 1930s, popular wisdom viewed economics through a biblical lens: recessions were the wages of sin. When good times lasted too long, businesses and individuals threw caution to the wind and behaved badly.

(Recessions) were regrettable but necessary correctives, like a detox program for a drunk."
My aunt was a high school field hockey coach, and I remember seeing her coach some games and looking at the goalie and what they have to wear. I was like, "Who would every want to be a goalie?

On the flip side, some major names were remarkably precise. The 2008 Migration Russian River Valley Chardonnay from Duckhorn was spot-on: 14.1 percent tested and on the label.

This won’t exactly curdle your coffee, but we’ll mention it anyway. This is who they are now, and for the foreseeable future. The Giants are not only flawed, at times they’re comically flawed.

Will Lee-Williams (Philly) sports nerdy, thick glasses and rolls through hits like "I'm Your Puppet" and "Me and Mrs. Jones." Alexander Elisa's Memphis is the least sophisticated of the trio but also the most sweet-natured. His gentle disposition gives extra heft to his renditions of "Hold On, I'm Coming" and "Tobacco Road." The most cocksure of the bunch is Detroit (Tyrick Wiltez Jones), who is sure that he has the competition won. After all, as he tells us, he has two distinct musical influences: He was born in the Motor City, but raised in Chicago. This double pedigree means he performs plenty of Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke and rolls through especially soulful renditions of "Lonely Teardrops," "Chain Gang" and "Wonderful World." Oddly missing, though, are the Motown classics you might expect to hear from an aspiring star with roots in the city that launched the careers of Smokey Robinson and Stevie Wonder.

I think it hurt everyone, Pioli said. Obviously no one had it, so it impacts everybody. I do think it may have impacted us a little bit differently than some maybe veteran teams because we had a group of guys that we drafted in 2010 that was a good class, we brought them in, they had their rookie minicamp, they had that little part of the offseason program, they had training camp, a season, and then the brakes are thrown on. So their development was held up a little bit.

“It's no secret that California's regulatory and tax climate is driving business investment to other states,” Cox wrote recently in the Wall Street Journal. “California's high cost of living also is driving people away. Since 2000 more than 1.6 million people have fled, and my own research, as well as that of others points, to high housing prices as the principal factor.”
To get you motivated, here are 10 things about Tokyo that are excellent.
Good Friday is equally curious. The exact origin of the name "Good" is unclear. Some say it was a shortening of "God Friday," as in "God be with you," or "good bye." Others attach a theological rational to the day by saying it was out of God's great love that Jesus died on the cross.
A two-sport star (he also excelled in basketball) at St. Peter's Prep, Lumpkin looks the part. Though he has actually added 25 pounds since arriving at Rutgers it has been a trade of baby fat for muscle. Now it's about mastering the nuances and technique of being a major college offensive tackle.

"The first goal, obviously, is 174," said Dean Crouser, Haley's dad and the Gresham throws coach. "Then, 175 seems to be a major milestone, 176 is the national record, 180 would be nice, and then just keep going."
Where was I? Oh, yes: the world's all-time coldest wind chill. That's what you're going to be feeling at this point in an Obama second term. If you like his contempt for judicial review, parliamentary scrutiny and representative democracy now, wait'll you see how "flexible" he'll get starting in January 2013. The CFPB appointment is not a small thing. Indeed, its new director, one Richard Cordray, embodies what's gone so disastrously wrong with American government: you'll have to be in compliance with him, but he doesn't have to be in compliance with anybody, whether the Senate or the Constitution. As I say somewhere in my recent book, you don't need a president-for-life if you've got a bureaucracy-for-life. More and more aspects of the citizen's daily existence are regulated by rules and officials both of which are ever more disconnected from any meaningful accountability to the people's representatives. As the president says, look for even more "flexibility" in a second term: more non-recess recess appointments, more executive orders, more bewildering innovations from the commissars of the hyper-regulatory state.

So whom does that leave? Well, there is … Mitt Romney. On Thursday he was clever and classy, characterizing the Iowa outcome as "a virtual tie" and taking time to "once again recognize Rick Santorum for his strong performance in the state."
It's bad for the public, which receives a carefully controlled side of the athlete or celebrity, and it's certainly bad for news media and chilling for a relatively transparent society. And whereas it might seem like this was Tiger’s best stroke in years, in the long run a voracious public will want more information that only an aggressive news media can provide.

But (and it's a very important but) support for the death penalty, in Connecticut and elsewhere, is not as robust as it looks. When Quinnipiac asked a different question  "Which punishment do you prefer for people convicted of murder, the death penalty or life in prison with no chance of parole?"  only 46 percent favored the death penalty. An equal number chose life without parole. Death penalty opponents have an opening they haven't had for some time.

So, if this can really be the end, the Is-Eli-Really-Elite Debate had a nice eight-year run. It started nearly from the moment he was drafted (Is He Worth Trading Up?) to his early seasons (Is He As Good As Philip Rivers?) and survived even through winning a Super Bowl. It was rekindled when, in a rare brazen moment, he lumped himself with Brady during an August radio interview.
Buddy Roemer is the only candidate talking about campaign finance reform, and the media is desperately trying to stifle his message. He has promised to take no donations over $100.

Delashmutt said police agencies go to state regulators when they can’t succeed in terminating an officer on their own. They want the state to end the officer’s career for them, most often levying allegations of dishonesty.
All these projects retained a good dose of Gallic soul -- in particular, an unwavering devotion to laborious Champenoise-method winemaking, which requires a second fermentation in the bottle to create the crucial tiny bubbles. Prior to their arrival, much American sparkling wine was made using Charmat, or closed-tank, method to get the fizz. Now the traditional method is standard for quality domestic sparklers.
"They take the extra two steps to play physical," Hitchcock said. "They score more than anybody I've seen off the cycle. So that's hard work, three on three down low. They just bury you in your own zone. I told our players, they play with a real hot pace and you're going to have to match it. So we're going to have to be up to speed right away. They pride themselves on making you react to the tempo."

But others believe technological innovations have a way to go before carbon-neutral luxury becomes standard. Charles McDowell, an estate agent in central London, points out that few top interior design firms are fully briefed on sustainability codes set by LEED (an internationally recognized green building certification system) or BREEAM (a voluntary measurement rating for green buildings established in the U.K.) Alex Michelin, director of Finchatton, a high-end interior design and development company, says: "The products out there are still far behind the labeling requirements set out under LEED and BREEAM. The whole supply chain—handles, fabrics, timber suppliers, electronics—all need to sign up to these codes before designers will have the information required to make informed decisions."
We would not waste our time exploring the depths of Mr. Limbaugh's misogyny or the likelihood of any genuine "heartfelt" remorse on his part, but we would note that he remains the poster child of public incivility, and the likelihood of further such incidents is high. The fact that advertisers are dropping his show, and some stations have decided no longer to carry it, is no surprise. Mitt Romney and other Republican candidates for office who wish to promote conservative views without them being associated with such personal attacks would be wise to offer a more robust denunciation of the talk show host than they have so far produced.
If it did opt for a name change, GM could wait and pick a new name to highlight how its business is reshaping, said William Lozito, president of Strategic Name Development, a brand naming company based in Minneapolis.

Off they go to investigate, and we see, playing the role of Bramble Haus, the Lion and the Rose Victorian bed and breakfast inn, actually located on Northeast 15th Avenue, near Lloyd Center. Never mind the fact that the plotline says the victim ran from the bed and breakfast to the bridge because it was so close. Only us locals are likely to find her ability to race from the Lloyd District to Troutdale, barefoot and nightgown-clad, remarkable. But it's still pretty funny, nevertheless.

Perhaps one of the most interesting characters, though, is the man we learn the least about. The mysterious Mr. Li, who lives on an ocean-worthy yacht named Invictus, is a representative of The System and coordinates its divisions in the field, so to speak. Readers can only hope that Epperson has a sequel on deck and that Mr. Li returns. What thriller fan doesn't love a shadowy character at the heart of an international crime conspiracy?
Earlier trials found the gel useful in women bothered by low desire following medically needed surgery to remove their ovaries. (Those sex organs produce roughly half a woman's natural testosterone. Though often thought of as a "male hormone," testosterone is tied to libido in both sexes.) A dollop a day of the gel on their arm boosted the frequency of satisfying sexual events compared with a placebo.

Along with SB 5 and redistricting, House Bill 194, Ohio's new elections law, is the other cause celebre for progressives pushing back on Republicans. The rules, which limit early voting and restrict other practices that have helped Democrats at the polls, are on hold pending the certification of referendum signatures.

"We started out well as a team, and my goal today was just to help the team as much as possible," said Goodman, who had a 220.3 average while placing 89 pins behind state champion Joey Kopera of Orland Park Sandburg. "A medal was kind of on my mind, too, because my sister (Natalie, a former girls state champion now a freshman at Vanderbilt) started medaling as a sophomore, too.
Hearing about the Great Race a few days ago, Tingay signed up. The rest was ... well, pretty darn speedy. His final time was 19:48, a consistent pace of less than five minutes per mile. In other words, he was on and off the course in slightly more than 19 minutes. If that wasn't a record, it was one of the all-time fastest finishes.

The judge concluded he was not guilty by reason of insanity, and sentenced him to Napa State Hospital. There, for the first time, he is receiving round-the-clock care and taking medication that has calmed his illness.
Overall, these things go in cycles for hoops. While we are fairly steady and/or growing in other sports areas, our basketball is up and down. We have had years in which there have been two guys going to Boston College (wow!) and others in which there have been none above the D-II level. A lot of it is reflective of our population and location. The Rocky Mountains have rarely been a hoops mecca or factory. But it would be nice if it was, wouldn't it?

Filling out this volume, and taking up more space than the verse, is extended commentary on the poems by Burnett, a professor of English at Boston University and editor of the Oxford editions of A.E. Housman's poems and letters. Burnett's tireless tracking down of bits and pieces of Larkin's work and his erudite annotations are an impressive act of scholarship. But while this volume certainly belongs in university libraries -- providing an amazingly detailed map of Larkin's development as an artist -- it will strike nonacademic readers as a form of overkill. Most readers will be far happier with "Collected Poems," edited by Anthony Thwaite, or a collection selected by Martin Amis.

SB1070, signed into law April 2010, included many anti-illegal immigration provisions and reignited the immigration debate in the country, sparking similar laws in other states, including Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina.
In truth, if they had their way we'd be back in the late 19th century -- before the federal income tax, antitrust laws, the Pure Food and Drug Act, and the Federal Reserve. A time when robber barons -- railroad, financial and oil titans -- ran the country. A time of wrenching squalor for the many and mind-numbing wealth for the few.
At the monstrous par-5 16th, Woods sent his drive into the right rough. He used a fairway metal to hit a hard slice through branches and into the middle of the fairway. The crowd roared -- but it wasn't the Tiger Roar.
When the Fox network celebrates its 25th anniversary Sunday night, there's one show that probably won't get a shout-out. "Mr. President," which debuted in 1987 alongside "Married ... With Children" and starred a particularly grumpy George C. Scott, lasted less than a year, furthering the notion that politics and prime-time entertainment usually make disastrous bedfellows.
For nearly 3﻿1/2 years, a black family has occupied the White House, and much of the time what has been most remarkable about that fact is how unremarkable it has become to the country.
After a grim 2009 tournament that featured just 27 tries in nine games, the 2010 competition produced 52, a record for the 16-year-old event. This year's tournament maintained that trend, with 26 tries in just six games. In addition, the number of passes has increased by 35% since 2009 and the average time that the ball is in play has increased by more than two minutes per match.

At 34, Hamilton has already started a small handful of companies. The best known is GreenPrint, which sought to shake up the printer business, much as he hopes to do to the disposable razor industry.
It wasn't until 2007, two years into the project, that he began to understand that he was going to need a personal lens. The catalyst was the suicide of his grandfather, Eugene Seelye, who had lived for 80 of his 83 years on the Leech Lake Reservation in Minnesota (where Treuer was also born and raised). "My grandfather's death was tragic," he says, "but his life was not tragic. I didn't want him to be defined in terms of his last fraction of a second when there was so much more." As an example, Treuer notes that Seelye lived in the only place that mattered to him, surrounded by the only people who mattered to him, a bounty that eludes many more overtly privileged lives.
In his March 9 motion, Burns accused his attorneys, Joseph Stazzone and Gary Bevilacque of failing to "follow up on investigative leads" that could help his case. Burns also argued communication breakdowns created "trust issues."
But the patchwork of measures -- including the implementation of austerity measures in Greece and approval by skeptical German and Dutch Parliaments -- required to give the rescue even a chance of success means it's unlikely to be the end of the continent's debt crisis.

“If I had too many bad feelings, I wouldn't be coming back at all,” said Dawkins, who has refuted the Eagles' claim that they made him an offer when his contract expired in 2008. “I grew to love the place, still love the place, and I'll just make that decision at some point.”
With West Virginia out of the picture (and the Scarlet Knight’s 17 game losing streak to them), Rutgers and Louisville will most likely be the media favorites. Rutgers will get Louisville at home and essentially replaces a trip to Morgantown with a trip to Philadelphia to play Temple - where as the road team Scarlet Knight fans could equal and perhaps outnumber Owl fans. This is not to say this schedule is not without its speed bumps. South Florida is notorious for playing well in September, having knocked off the likes of Florida State and Notre Dame in recent years only to take a swan dive in the latter months of the season. Rutgers has not won in Cincinnati in three tries during Big East play. Couple this with back-to-back road trips with Pittsburgh following the Cincinnati game and the USF game will carry even more significance. Should Rutgers prevail in Tampa and knock off their two local rivals at home in Connecticut and Syracuse, they will give themselves a cushion against the Bearcats and Pittsburgh should they lose to one of those two. Providing USF doesn’t win out after the early loss to the Scarlet Knights, even with one conference loss for Rutgers the Cardinals would have no way of clinching before the Thursday night matchup.
Star-studded casts certainly didn't hurt its popular runs in Paris (with Isabelle Huppert), London (Ralph Fiennes, Janet McTeer) and on Broadway (James Gandolfini, Marcia Gay Harden). San Jose Rep Artistic Director Rick Lombardo's staging proves it doesn't need big names to get its full quotient of laughs.

The guidelines also lay out how state regulators would choose applicants if more than two compete to build the new gambling halls. They include evaluating how many jobs the projects would create, how quickly they could get started, how much financing is available, the companies' experience in building similar projects elsewhere, and the level of neighborhood benefits, like infrastructure improvements, that would be included in the plans.

The kufta kebabs ($12.95) are also redolent of mint, which, with a judicious amount of salt, spices and smoke from the grill, make the ground beef patties very satisfying. They arrive with a generous spread of sides: homemade bread, thick-cut fries and two salads that are also available a la carte. Zaalouk is a chunky eggplant and tomato mixture with a melty texture similar to caponata, and shalada has a tomato and parsley brightness similar to tabbouleh, without the bulgur.

Cora, 36, played all infield positions last season with the Washington Nationals but has spent the vast majority of his 14-year career at shortstop and second base.

“We’ve had a heck of week,” Bollendorf said, adding that Petolicchio’s role as a counselor was key to helping students make it through the difficult time.

Carter and Malone turned in a tasty performance of "Samba de Orpheus" (from the 1959 film, "Black Orpheus") that included a transcendently eloquent bass solo.

On Mondays, The Venue becomes Tampa Bay's preeminent party, thanks to the hottest hospitality night in town: S.I.N., short for Service Industry Night. The drink specials ($2 you-call-its, $150 SKYY bottles) are good enough, but the real prize is a $500 tab awarded to the business with the most employees present.

We wanted a medium-sized city that allowed easy access to suburban and urban areas. I've always loved Portland, but we shoot in L.A. We do have our little magical backdrops that locate us in three different random locations in (Portland). I think the boss can see Mount Hood from his window.

This has made Pennsylvania's five-term Sen. Arlen Specter the archetypal figure for this year, a man who was literally run out of the Republican Party by the challenge of a junior former House member and the ill-financed Tea Party movement, and then upset in his new home in the Democratic primary by an even more unknown Joe Sestak, a stranger to most voters across the state until his ads began three weeks before Election Day.

One of the biggest reasons The X Factor is such a hit in The United Kingdom is the judging panel. Over seven seasons, judges have consisted of Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne, Dannii Minogue (Kylie Minogue’s sister), Cheryl Cole (we will discuss later), and others you probably don’t know. The chemistry, and sometimes lack thereof, between the judges is one of the elements that makes The X Factor what it is.

Personal story: "Sophomore year during a soccer game, I fell and found out that I had torn my labrum in my shoulder. I would have to have surgery. After having six anchors put in my shoulder and months of rehab, it came time for softball season again. I was not yet able to throw; I even tried to switch to throw left-handed, but it didn't work.

Over the course of four movies, Ripley continually bests murderous space monsters and a cold foreboding cosmos where no one can hear you scream.
